  abstract = {The target tracking system of an IR (InfraRed) guided missile is constantly subjected to disturbances due to the linear and angular motion of the missile. To diminish these LOS (Line Of Sight) disturbances the seeker of the missile can be built from a free gyroscope mounted in a very low friction suspension. The ability of the spinning gyroscope to maintain its direction relative to an inertial frame is
used to stabilize the seeker LOS while tracking a target. The tracking velocity of the seeker, i.e., its angular velocity, is controlled by a feedback control unit where the signal from the IR detector is used as input. The
electrical driven actuator consists of a set of coils and a magnet on the gyroscope. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a real-time model of the seeker gyroscope in an existing IR MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) missile. The aim is a model that is able to simulate the real system with consideration to the tracking velocity. The model should also be integrated into a hybrid simulator environment.},

  abstract  = {Beginning in the early 1970's, the then Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory initiated a program to develop computer-based atmospheric radiative transfer algorithms. The first attempts were translations of graphical procedures described in a 1970 report on The Optical Properties of the Atmosphere1a,b, based on empirical transmission functions and effective absorption coefficients derived primarily from controlled laboratory transmittance measurements. The fact that spectrally-averaged atmospheric transmittance (T) does not obey the Beer-Lambert Law T=exp(), where is a species absorption cross section, independent of , the species column amount along the path at any but the finest spectral resolution was already well known. Band models to describe this gross behavior were developed in the 1950's and 60's (see textbooks such as Goody2 or Goody and Yung3). Thus began LOWTRAN, the Low Resolution Transmittance Code, first released in 19724a. This limited initial effort has now progressed to a set of codes and related algorithms (including line-of-sight spherical geometry, direct and scattered radiance and irradiance, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, etc.) that contain thousands of coding lines, hundreds of subroutines, and improved accuracy, efficiency, and, ultimately, accessibility. This review will include LOWTRAN4b,c,d, HITRAN (atlas of high-resolution molecular spectroscopic data5a,b,c), FASCODE (Fast Atmospheric Signature Code6a,b,c,d), and MODTRAN (Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code7a,b,c), their permutations, validations, and applications, particularly as related to recent upgrades. 2.BACKGROUND A history of the code evolution has already been compiled in a 1990 report entitled "Historical Brief of Geophysics Laboratory (GL) Atmospheric Propagation Codes for DoD Systems"8, authored by Ruth Liebowitz, PL/GP Historian; a small portion of this report annotates the institutional name changes under which the work was written; acronyms include AFCRC, AFCRL, AFGL, GL, and most recently, Phillips Laboratory/Geophysics Directorate or PL/GP. Because of the changing nomenclature, GeoPhysics Directorate (GP) will be given general attribution. Written from the Air Force/Department of Defense viewpoint, the report emphasizes military applications. However, of equal importance in the code evolution have been numerous applications by the general scientific community, those users who have found a reliable and mostly amenable resource. As part of this larger community, the GP codes have been rigorously tested. This international collaboration has been continuous and encouraged, blending individual contributions as simple as errata on the definition of Lambertian scattering (where, in fact, a factor of was missing), to continual re-evaluation against measurements over the dry Israeli deserts9 and cold Canadian plains10,11. Accurate acknowledgment of contributions to an evolving program that is nearing its 25th Anniversary requires attributions beyond the already large authorship list. The authors are only those contributors who participated as AFGL/GP employees during the years of code evolution. An admittedly partial search of the number of explicitly funded AF contractual contributions and their authors exceeds 35 and 100, respectively. Therefore, no particular attribution listing will be compiled other than the accompanying references. The largest set of external contributors is even harder to appropriately acknowledge; they have, via both deliberate and inadvertent participation, provided direction and prioritization of component elements through their judicious comparisons of code calculations against both theoretical and experimental (laboratory and atmospheric) results. Such contributions have come from U.S. government agencies (Navy, Army, NASA, NOAA, DOE, NSF, NTIS, etc.) and government-funded corporations. (More specifically, the Navy and the Army have supplied entire subroutine capabilities,},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the influence of the Stiles-Crawford effect (SCE) of the first kind on the contrast sensitivity function using the apodisation model of the SCE. The SCE was measured for the right eyes of two subjects using an increment threshold technique involving a two-channel Maxwellian-viewing system. Filters made of photographic film neutralised or doubled the SCE. Contrast sensitivities were measured with a 6 mm pupil diameter, defocus to 2D, and three SCE conditions (normal, neutralised and doubled). Modulation transfer functions were derived after measuring transverse aberrations with a vernier alignment technique, and were used to predict contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs). The measured CSFs were, in general, reasonable matches with the predicted CSFs. In particular, both demonstrated definite undulations (??notches??) as defocus level increased. The influences of the SCE-modifying filters were generally of similar magnitude and direction to predictions, thus supporting the apodisation model of the SCE. The magnitudes of SCE influence between SCE-neutralised and SCE-doubled conditions were usually small at about 0.2? 0.3 log unit, with a maximum influence of 0.5 log unit. Influences of the SCE were greater for myopic than for hypermetropic defocus. As measured by the CSF and an apodisation model, this study is in agreement with previous theoretical work and one experimental study in indicating that the SCE plays a minor role in improving spatial visual performance.},

  Abstract                 = {To correctly model the target acquisition capability of an electro-optic system manned by a human, the basic process of how the human visual system interacts with the scene must be considered. The Center for Night Vision and Electro-Optics (CNVEO) model has analyzed the detection of targets both in the static situation and in the case of a person searching a field of regard. However, this model does not provide a quantitative measure of the clutter of a scene. In this paper, we propose two new metrics of clutter, derived from our understanding of the human visual system. The first is a metric based on the distinctness of the target in its surroundings, that can be used both locally for target contrast and globally for overall clutter. The second is a metric based on the calculation of likely fixation points of a human observer. We compare the results to an experiment performed at Hughes Corporation and described in our paper.},

The developed algorithm can simulate passive IR imaging seeker engagements with aerial  targets. The presented algorithm uses the developed models for IR  signature of the target, the background, the flare spectral and temporal responses and the flare ballistic trajectory. The missile guidance,  auto-pilot and tracker algorithms have also been developed. The  atmospheric conditions have been modelled, using LOWTRAN, as good, typical or bad to account for atmospheric transmittance and the  sky-radiance. The results were analysed and validated through four test scenarios.

abstract="Solid-state photon detectors based on wide band gap semiconductors are not yet considered mature 
technology but their current development opens new possibilities, also for space observations. 
Such devices are especially attractive for ultraviolet radiation detection, as semiconductor materials with
 band gaps larger than that of silicon can be produced and used as ``visible-blind'' or ``solar-blind'' 
 detectors that are not affected by daylight. Here we evaluate the advantages of such detectors compared 
 to silicon-based devices and report on the semiconductor detectors that have been fabricated in recent 
 years with materials having large band gap energies. We describe the most common pixel designs and characterize
  their general properties.",

IR spectra of the missile plume are calculated both with the high spectral resolution line-by-line radiation model FASCODE 3 (fast atmospheric signature code) using the databases HITEMP or HITRAN and the low spectral resolution IR radiation model NIRATAM (NATO InfraRed Air TArget Model) using molecular band model technique. The influence of the atmosphere on the IR spectra as viewed from a space born sensor is taken into account. The results show, that using an elaborate line-by-line radiation model can improve the accuracy in computation of IR signature compared to the simpler but faster molecular band model technique used in NIRATAM. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical model for the edge image waviness effect is developed for the ground-to-ground scenario and validated by use IR imagery data collected at the White Sands Missile Range. It is shown that angle-of-arrival (AA) angular anisoplanatism causes the phenomenon of edge image waviness and that the AA correlation scale, not the isoplanatic angle, characterizes the edge image waviness scale. The latter scale is determined by the angular size of the imager and a normalized turbulence outer scale, and it does not depend on the strength of turbulence along the path. Spherical divergence of the light waves increases AA correlation. A procedure for estimating the atmospheric and camera-noise components of the edge image motion is developed, and implemented. A technique for mitigation of the edge image waviness that relies on averaging the effects of AA anisoplanatism on the image is experimentally validated. The edge waviness variance is reduced by a factor of 2 - 3. The time history and temporal power spectrum of the edge motion are obtained. These data confirm that the observed edge motion is caused by turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {The Automated Objective Minimum Resolvable Temperature Difference (AO-MRTD) is an approach to provide an automated and objective measure of a thermal imager's performance. The algorithm is intended to provide a more accurate, reliable and cost effective figure of merit than traditional subjective MRTD measurements. MRTD values are calculated using signal-to-noise ratios obtained by match filtering digitized images of low contrast four bar patterns. Match filters are constructed from a high contrast image of the four bar patterns and the algorithm can assess sensor performance beyond Nyquist [similar to the minimum temperature difference perceived (MTDP) figure of merit]. The MRTD values derived by the algorithm do not represent the minimum temperature differences perceived by human observes; however, simple modifications to the threshold signal-to-noise ratio result in human-like MRTD values. The algorithm has the flexibility to construct multiple types of match filters derived from a single high contrast image. Currently, the algorithm derives separate MRTD values for match filters corresponding to the bar pattern and it's derivative. Preliminary results suggest that a combination of the two match filters may yield a match to the human subjective MRTD results. The basic construction and operation of the algorithm is outlined.},

The site seeing is excellent (median 0.7 arcsec), dome seeing is negligible, and preliminary studies indicate that most of the atmospheric seeing originates in a well-defined layer at low altitude, which bodes well for future laser-guide-star AO. The Durham group have built up extensive experience with natural-guide-star adaptive-optics experiments at the GHRIL Nasmyth focus, and the NAOMI common-user AO facility is due to be commissioned at this focus early in 2000. NAOMI will provide near-diffraction-limited imaging in the IR (Strehl ~0.6, FWHM ~0.15 arcsec in K) and is expected to give significant correction in the optical (poorer Strehl, but similar FWHM). NAOMI will perform better at short wavelengths than AO systems on other telescopes, and observers will require instrumentation that can exploit this crucial advantage.},

The developed prototype detects scene changes in zones of interest, stores these images and can evidence the scene modifications in the picture. The used method, based on a cross-correlation function between observed and reference image, is to large extent insensible to illumination variations and sensor noise. In its present state the application of the system is limited to situations with few scene changes in the zones of interest (f. i. storage areas).

First, the image containing the test object was spatially blurred by an amount varying from one pixel up to the maximum blur at which the object could still be identified or resolved. This mimics the effect of sensor optics and detector blur on the image of a target at different ranges. Then, band-limited noise was added to the image. The center spatial frequency f<sub>c</sub> of the masking noise was varied over 7.0 octaves. Observers had to indicate at which target contrast they were just able to identify the target. The results are a) identification thresholds for all targets are strongly elevated by masking noise of certain spatial wavelengths and much less by coarser or finer noise, showing that identification by human observers is mediated by a relatively narrow visual filter, and b) with increasing blur, maximum masking shifts towards lower noise spatial frequencies in a consistent but non-linear way. Current popular TA models are inconsistent with these results but suggestions for improvement are presented. The laboratory test patterns are appropriate to characterize target acquisition performance with viewing systems that include noise and blur.},

  Abstract                 = {At the moment there are three potential models and associated measures to replace the FLIR92 model and the MRTD as the standard for sensor performance characterization and TA range predictions. These are: 1) the NVTherm model that calculates the MRTD-ID, 2) the TRM3 model that calculates the MTDP and 3) the TOD model that calculates the TOD. The three models are grossly different in theoretical approach. We ran the models for the same set of hypothetical cameras. As default sensor, we used a 'typical' under-sampled Focal Plane Array camera. Then, we independently varied the pre- and post-filter MTF's over a wide range while keeping the sampling frequency fixed so that the cameras ranged between well-sampled and highly under-sampled. The differences in outcome are striking. For example, for a range of sensors around the default the TOD model predicts that performance is determined primarily by the sampling frequency, while NVTherm predicts that pre- an post-filter blur dominate in this region. The results with TRM3 are surprising: the model predicts that increasing image information content by applying microscan to the default sensor, decreases predicted TA performance. The origin lies in the use of the periodic four-bar test pattern and the definition of the MTDP. In the low contrast region, the MTDP and the TOD are similar but the MRTD-ID deviates from these two. The MTDP and MRTD-ID are different even in the well-sampled region where they both should be equivalent to the conventional MRTD. The study shows that the choice of a model has a large impact on sensor design decisions or trade-offs between sensors. The TOD method is the most general of the three approaches and has the strongest basis. Until now, validation of the model predictions is very limited. Therefore, a joint TA performance study with simulated sensors (e.g., those used in the present study) and target contrast as variables would be very useful.},

  Abstract                 = {The characterization of electro-optical system performance by means of the standard minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) or the minimum resolvable contrast (MRC) has a number of serious disadvantages. One of the problems is that they depend on the subjective decision criterion of the observer. We present an improved measurement procedure in which the results are free from observer bias. In an adaptive two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) procedure, both the standard four-bar pattern and a five-bar reference pattern of the same size and contrast are presented consecutively in random order. The observer decides which of the two presentations contains the four-bar pattern. Misjudgments are made if the bars cannot be resolved or are distorted by sampling. The procedure converges to the contrast at which 75% of the observer responses are correct. The reliability of the responses is tested statistically. Curves cut off near the Nyquist frequency, so that it is not necessary to artificially set a frequency limit for sampling array cameras. The procedure enables better and easier measurement, yields more stable results than the standard procedure, and avoids disputes between different measuring teams. The presented procedure is a 'quick fix' solution for some of the problems with the MRTD and MRC, and is recommended as long as bar patterns are used as the stimulus. A new and fundamentally better method to characterize electro-optical system performance, called the triangle orientation discrimination threshold (TOD) was recently proposed by Bijl and Valeton (1998).},

  abstract  = {Man Portable Air Defence Systems (ManPADs) have been a favoured anti aircraft weapon since their
appearance on the military proliferation scene in the mid 1960s. Since this introduction there has been
a cat and mouse game of Missile Countermeasures (CMs) and the aircraft protection counter counter
measures (CCMs) as missile designers attempt to defeat the aircraft platform protection equipment. Magnesium
Teflon Viton (MTV) flares protected the target aircraft until the missile engineers discovered the
art of flare rejection using techniques including track memory and track angle bias. These early CCMs
relied upon CCM triggering techniques such as the rise rate method which would just sense a sudden
increase in target energy and assume that a flare CM had been released by the target aircraft. This was
not as reliable as was first thought as aspect changes (bringing another engine into the field of view)
or glint from the sun could inadvertently trigger a CCM when not needed. The introduction of dual band
detectors in the 1980s saw a major advance in CCM capability allowing comparisons between two distinct
IR bands to be made thus allowing the recognition of an MTV flare to occur with minimal false
alarms. The development of the rosette scan seeker in the 1980s complemented this advancement allowing
the scene in the missile field of view (FOV) to be scanned by a much smaller (1/25) instantaneous FOV
(IFOV) with the spectral comparisons being made at each scan point. This took the ManPAD from a basic
IR energy detector to a pseudo imaging system capable of analysing individual elements of its overall FOV
allowing more complex and robust CCM to be developed. This paper continues the work published in
[1,2] and describes the method used to model an advanced ManPAD with a rosette scanning seeker head
and robust CCMs similar to the Raytheon Stinger RMP.},

@Book{Born2000,
  Title                    = {Principles of Optics},
  Abstract                 = {Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth century, and probably the most influential book in optics published in the past 40 years. The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the CAT scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.},

Cross-sectional analysis of the etched surface has allowed, for the first time, an accurate determination of the scale of the enhanced morphologies produced and the thickness of the oxidised black layer itself.

  Abstract                 = {A prototype automated forward looking infrared (FLIR) minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) evaluation software system was developed and tested. After data capture and preliminary image processing of FLIR 4-bar target imagery, the boundary contour system (BCS) model of the human early vision system was coupled with a custom feature extractor to produce a set of features characteristic of those employed by humans during detection tasks. These feature sets, along with known target visibility, were used to train a fuzzy adaptive resonance theory MAP (ARTMAP) decision algorithm to emulate human observer performance in determining MRTD as a function of target to background contrast and target spatial frequency. During prototype system evaluation, the system was trained on 180 pairs of input imagery and human observer response data (resolvable/not-resolvable), and then tested against another 60 input images without the human judgments. The system predictions of human response to the test images were than compared to actual human response decisions for the images. Prototype success rates in the range of 96% to 100% were achieved in correctly predicting human response MRTD decisions in a low fidelity situation.},

Simulations showed that target detection probabilities could be accounted for by a simple transformation on the summed outputs of a two layer filter model similar to the complex channels model proposed by Graham, Beck and Sutter (Graham, N., Beck, J., & Sutter, A. (1992). Vision Research, 32, 719-743). Subsequently, the model was tested on the detection of camouflaged vehicle targets with encouraging results.},

Unless corrected, these phase distortions, which vary rapidly with time and from antenna to antenna, seriously compromise the sensitivity and image quality of these arrays. Building on the success of a prototype infrared radiometer for millimeter astronomy (IRMA I), which was used to measure atmospheric water vapour column abundance, this thesis presents results from a second generation radiometer (IRMA II) operating at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii from December, 2000 to March, 2001. These results include comparisons with other measures of water vapour abundance available on the summit of Mauna Kea and a comparison with a theoretical curve-of-growth calculated from a new radiative transfer model, ULTRAM, developed specifically for the purpose.

High degree of accuracy in the higher frequency region (near the Nyquist frequency of the system) was achieved by reducing the noise. In the first method which is a variant of the original Gans' method, this was achieved by subtracting out the stationary noise (whose frequency lies predominantly beyond the Nyquist frequency of the display) from the ESF. The second method employs a low-pass differentiator (LPD). A near-maximally flat low-pass differentiator with the desired cut-off frequency was designed for the purpose. The noise reduction in both the methods was also achieved by averaging over large portions of the ESF. The MTF obtained was comparable to that obtained from the square wave response. Further, the MTFs of rising and falling edges of a CRT were measured. It was found that the rising and falling vertical MTFs have practically the same MTFs, whereas, the rising horizontal MTF is poor than the falling horizontal MTF in the mid-frequency region.},

  Abstract                 = {The wave front field aberrations induced by atmospheric turbulence can severely degrade the performance of an optical imaging system. Adaptive optics refers to the process of removing unwanted wave front distortions in real time, i.e., before the image is formed, with the use of a phase corrector. The basic idea in adaptive optics is to control the position of the surface of a deformable mirror in such a way as to approximately cancel the atmospheric turbulence effects on the phase of the incoming light wave front. A phase computation system, referred to as a reconstructor, transforms the output of a wave front sensor into a set of drive signals that control the shape of a deformable mirror. The control of a deformable mirror is often based on a linear wave front reconstruction algorithm that is equivalent to a matrix-vector multiply. The matrix associated with the reconstruction algorithm is called the reconstructor matrix. Since the entire process, from the acquisition of wave front measurements to the positioning of the surface of the deformable mirror, must be performed at speeds commensurate with the atmospheric changes, the adaptive optics control imposes several challenging computational problems.The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) to describe a simplified yet feasible mathematical framework that accounts for the interactions among main components involved in an adaptive optics imaging system, and (ii) to present several ways to estimate the reconstructor matrix based on this framework. The performances of these various reconstruction techniques are illustrated using some simple computer simulations.},

Hidden spring structure is used in order to maximize the fill-factor and minimize diffraction effect. A designed micro-SLM is composed of a mirror plate, upper electrodes, five support posts, and bottom electrodes. The spring structures are composed of four double crab leg springs for phase modulation (piston mode operation) and two torsional springs for amplitude modulation (tilt mode operation). The micro-SLM is actuated by electrostatic force generated between upper electrode and bottom electrode. In case of phase modulation, the maximum deflection length of mirror plate is designed to be 4 [mu]m and in case of amplitude modulation, micro-SLM is designed to be capable of tilting +/-5.4[deg] to reflect incident light. The designed micro-SLM array is successfully fabricated with surface micromachining technology using thick photoresist as a sacrificial layer and aluminum as a structural material. Mirror plate and spring structure are fabricated without initial bending problem. The resulting fill-factor is about 91.7%. Static and dynamic characteristics of the fabricated micro-SLM in the case of amplitude modulation are measured with optical measurement system. In the fields of adaptive optics and pattern recognition system, SLM is used to modulate the phase and amplitude of incident light in order to correct aberration in an optical system through active control of mirror array.},

This communication is intended to provide a coherent summary of the various radiative transfer models and associated databases publicly available from AER (http://www.rtweb.aer.com). Among the communities using the models are the remote sensing community (e.g., TES, IASI), the numerical weather prediction community (e.g., ECMWF, NCEP GFS, WRF, MM5), and the climate community (e.g.,ECHAM5). Included in this communication is a description of the central features and recent updates for the following models: the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM); the line file creation program (LNFL); the longwave and shortwave rapid radiative transfer models, RRTM_LW and RRTM_SW; theMonochromatic Radiative Transfer Model (MonoRTM); theMT_CKD Continuum; and the Kurucz Solar Source Function. LBLRTM and the associated line parameter database (e.g., HITRAN 2000 with 2001 updates) play a central role in the suite of models. The physics adopted for LBLRTM has been extensively analyzed in the context of closure experiments involving the evaluation of the model inputs (e.g., atmospheric state), spectral radiative measurements and the spectral model output. The rapid radiative transfer models are then developed and evaluated using the validated LBLRTM model.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient management of a road network requires continuous decision-making based on conditions on the network and an understanding of the impacts of the decisions made. These conditions are usually measured with fixed-point surveillance systems, most of which are deployed in such a manner as to require communication links that are always connected and are polled at regular intervals. All of the sensor data are typically sent to a Traffic Management Center (TMC) for assessment, yet most of the time no action is taken in response to the data, leading to unnecessarily high communication costs. To reduce communication costs without a significant loss in the quality of information received at the TMC, this paper lays the foundation for an event driven communication system by examining the information value of specific events at the detectors. This procedure can then be used to offload a portion of the decision making from the TMC to the field controllers, which would make the initial valuation of information and only send data that might elicit a control response or benefit comparative decisions between detector stations. In other words, rather than relying on the conventional, centrally polled communication system, these events could be used to initiate communication from the field when the potential value outweighs the cost per communication. The information value could also lead to better data handling for decision-making or archiving in a conventional, polled communication system. We develop the methodology by deconstructing an incident on a freeway and identify the observable events at a pair of detector stations that may be upstream, downstream or straddle the incident. This analytical process could be repeated for any other condition of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a real-time foveation system for remote and distributed surveillance. The system performs face detection, tracking, selective encoding of the face and background, and efficient data transmission. A Java-based client-server architecture connects a radial network of camera servers to their central processing unit. Each camera server includes a detection and tracking module that signals the human presence within an observation area and provides the 2D face coordinates and its estimated scale to the video transmission module. The captured video data are then efficiently represented in log-polar coordinates, with the foveation point centered on the face, and sent to the connecting client modules for further processing. The current set-up of the system employs active cameras that track the detected person, by switching between smooth pursuit and saccadic movements, as a function of the target presence in the fovea region. High reconstruction resolution in the fovea region enables the successive application of recognition/verification modules on the transmitted video without sacrificing their performance. The system modules are well suited for implementation on the next generation of Java-based intelligent cameras. &copy; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In short, they are becoming practical for space, missile, and man-portable applications. The technologies that are making this possible include highly integrated low power electronics, new processing architectures for error sensing and control, flexible high density packaging, and especially MOEMS. Micromirror design, mirror array design, and design tradeoffs are discussed, as well as high density packaging for combining MEMS-specific die with standard electronic die.

  abstract  = {-Terrain categorization and target detection algorithms applied to Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) typically operate on the measured reflectance (of sun and sky illumination) by an object or scene. Since the reflectance is a non-dimensional ratio, the reflectance by an object is nominally not affected by variations in lighting conditions. Atmospheric Correction (also uferred to as Atmospheric `Compensation', `Characterization', etc.) Algorithms (ACAs) are used in applications of remotely sensed HSI data to correct for the effects of atmospheric propagation on measurements acquired by air and space-borne systems. The Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) algorithm is an ACA created for HSI applications in the visible through shortwave infrared (VisSWIR) spectral regime. FLAASH derives its `physics-based' mathematics from MODTRAN4.},

  Abstract                 = {Ground-based telescopes suffer from atmospheric turbulences which perturb the quality of the light arriving from space. Astronomers use adaptive optics in order to correct the wavefront of oncoming light. In this context, a prototype of electromagnetic miniature (O 50 mm) deformable mirror is developed, using available microtechnologies. The mirror is composed of a thin polymer membrane (2-5 [mu]m) covered with a matrix of permanent magnets, and of an array of planar microcoils on a O 50 mm substrate. The paper presents the various technologies used to build the actuator (membranes, coils, magnets). The mechanical behaviour of the mirror is tested. Deformations of up to 20 [mu]m are achieved with currents in the range 1-3 A (6.6 [mu]m/A). Resonance occurs at 485 Hz, with good linearity up to 200 Hz.},

Bayesian Network (BN) modeling is a promising method to achieve this, in particular if done in a participatory manner. Based on a review of 30 cases of participatory BN modeling of environmental problem fields, and of three guidelines, we summarize recommendations for BN modeling with stakeholder involvement. In addition, strengths and limitations of BNs are synthesized. We found that BNs were successfully applied for knowledge integration and identification of sustainable management strategies within participatory processes. Due to many favorable characteristics, BNs have the potential to become a core method of transdisciplinary knowledge integration in environmental management.},

  Abstract                 = {Determination of the performance of undersampled IR cameras by means of four-bar patterns suffers from aliasing for spatial frequencies above the Nyquist limit. An alternative method, using two parallel line sources, is described. This method avoids the aliasing effect and allows a reproduceable way for performance measurements by simple variation of the spacing between the two line sources and their temperatures. The modulation depth at optimum phase is measured in the camera display or electronics, similar to the classical Rayleigh criterion. Additional benefits of the new method are the simple target construction (only one target is required) and the ease to model line sources. The result of a performance measurement is similar to the standard MRTD (Minimum Resolvable Temperature Difference) method, where sensor resolution is coupled to range for a given target size and contrast. The new method has therefore the potential to be implemented into the present STANAG4347 and 4349. Results of performance measurements, carried out with the uncooled Thermacam PM395 camera and other cameras, are shown. Predicted and measured performance agree very well.},

  Abstract                 = {A configuration for the Future Giant Telescope is proposed. It is a 30m telescope with segmented primary mirror and alt-azimuth mounting. The aspherical f/1.2 primary mirror is made up of 1095 partial annular submirrors. The optical system includes a Nasmyth system, a coude system and a wide field system. The Nasmyth system has a novel design with four mirrors and provides a [not, vert, similar]10 arcmin field of diffraction-limited images, a much larger field than can be obtained by the traditional Nasmyth system. Several diffraction-limited observations each over a small field, can be carried out simultaneously. By applying active optics to change the shape, tip, tilt and piston of the submirrors, thereby to effect a new aspherical surface of the primary, excellent quality images can be obtained for the coude system and the wide field system. The wide field system has a field of 25 arcmin, the focal surface is only slightly curved and the atmospheric dispersion could be corrected. The tolerances of the surface shape and position for the submirrors, and the telescope mounting and structure are also discussed. The innovations in this configuration should have a general significance for future giant telescopes.},

An outline of the mechanical and electronic arrangement of MARTINI is given, together with a description of its modes of operation, facilities and performance.

  Abstract                 = {Current target acquisition models are for monochrome imagery systems (single detector). The increasing interest in multi-spectral infrared systems and color daylight imagers highlights the need for models that describe the target acquisition process for color systems (2 or more detectors). This study investigates the detection of simple color targets in a noisy color background. Color targets are varied separately either in hue or saturation. Noise is created with a mixture of random hue and saturation combinations. Our preliminary result showed a simple two-color (yellow-blue) representation did not improve the standard black-and-white Minimum Resolvable Temperature Difference sensitivity. Subsequent psychophysical experiments reveal that human hue and saturation discriminations interact (the Abney effect) and need to be separated in color target detection modeling. Research is continuing to better define the mathematical relationship between the target acquisition parameters (e.g., temperature difference or intensity contrast) and the color space of hue and saturation.},

  Abstract                 = {Current imaging system performance models use either the minimum resolvable temperature difference or the minimum resolvable contrast concepts to predict target identification performance. Both of these performance functions describe the limiting frequency that can be viewed through the imaging system at a particular contrast. No credit is given to the system for the amount of low frequency (lower than the limiting frequency) information that is passed through the system. We determine whether the low spatial frequency information is important in the target identification task. Previous experiments show that no degradation is seen on character recognition if a high-pass, edge enhancing filter is applied to character images. This is not the case in target identification performance, where the targets of interest are military tanks. A number of filters (six levels of blur at four bandwidth configurations) are applied to tank imagery including high-pass filters to reduce the low frequency image content. A perception experiment is performed to determine whether target identification performance was degraded with a reduced amount of low spatial frequency image content. The probability of target identification is calculated from the observer responses and the identification performance is evaluated as a function of low spatial frequency image content. Low frequency information is shown to contribute to the overall system performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Target acquisition is fairly straight forward when tracking a single bright target. A dim target in clutter on the other hand can present some challenges in target acquisition. The characteristics of detecting a target under typical conditions are fairly well understood. For example, one way to characterize signal detection is by constructing the receiver operating curve. By contrast the characteristics of acquisition of a dim target in persistent background clutter can be very different from signal detection. For example, an acquisition can be a false acquisition even with the target in the field of view. A false acquisition is typically based on clutter points or false signals rather than the target. Given a target of interest in the field of view, the indicated false acquisition can be far from the location of the true target. The term acquisition used in this context is not the same as signal o target detection. In this sense, acquisition requires making the distinction between a detection or sequence of detections caused by a target versus that caused by false signals and persistent clutter. This paper presents an analysis of the differences between the characteristics of detection and acquisition. Analysis and understanding the characteristics of target acquisition are important for undertaking the specification, design or performance evaluation of a sensor system. To limit the scope to within the page limits, this paper concentrates on acquisition of a single, small, dim target with false signals and persistent background clutter (possibly moving) in the field of view.},

The measured coatings included Nextel Velvet Black, an anodised coating and NPLSuperBlack. The anodised coating exhibited substantial variations in its diffuse and regular reflectance values after thermal and simulated solar ageing. Solar and thermal ageing of the Nextel Velvet Black resulted in increases of its reflectance. However, thermal ageing tended to decrease the reflectance of the other paint samples examined. Thermal and solar ageing of the NPLSuperBlack resulted in only minor changes in its reflectance characteristics. All measurements are traceable to the UK National Standards.},

With these sensors of improved spatial resolution, however, the user community faces a new problem in the analysis of this type of image data. Standard classification techniques have to be augmented for an appropriate analysis because the necessary homogeneity of landuse/landcover classes can no longer be achieved by the integration effect of large pixel sizes (e.g., 20 - 80 m). New intelligent techniques will have to be developed that make use of multisensor approaches, GIS integration and context based interpretation schemes.

  Abstract                 = {Switching-on an adaptive optics loop, the system usually rapidly locks the target in the correction mode. When the sky background contribution is not negligible, the SNR may depend upon the correction status. While in an already closed loop, the SNR could be high enough to maintain the situation of good correction by the adopt system, during the switching-on phase, this condition could be far from true, because it is possible that the SNR isn't enough to lock the loop, starting from the open loop situation. We discuss this problem (called the bootstrap problem for adaptive optics) with particular attention on some filtering system working in the described situation and tuned to solve the problem.},

In order to know the effect of the modifications on radiative transfer calculation with high spectral resolution, comparison in optical depth and radiance spectrum have been given between different editions. Four infrared spectral regions are selected, and they cover the three bands of atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) and one of geosynchronous imaging fourier transform spectrometer (GIFTS). The comparison has shown that the relative difference between HITRAN 2000 and 2004 and that between HITRAN 1996 and 2004 is decreasing. But the maximal discrepancy between the latest two editions in some spectral intervals is over 1%. It is important to estimate the error of calculation with the line parameters correctly or one has to use the new edition of HITRAN.},

Although some European radar and optical facilities for space object tracking exist, there is no operational European space surveillance system. An ESA-funded feasibility study for a future independent European space surveillance capability was performed recently. Some of the main conclusions are presented here. We discuss the surveillance of the geostationary ring (GEO) by evaluating existing and newly designed optical ground-based sensors in terms of their performance. The main performance-related issues --- the coverage of the GEO ring and the minimum detectable objects size --- are discussed. In order to perform detailed simulations, an observation strategy was defined and algorithms for the correlation of objects with a catalogue and for the maintenance of that catalogue were developed. We used the ESA PROOF software to estimate the sensor performance and AIUB tools to simulate the catalogue correlation. The performance was validated using data from campaigns performed with the ESA Space Debris Telescope at Tenerife, Spain.},

Research on transmission of laser beams from the ground to satellites was carried out. It was proposed that detection of the atmospheric back scatter of some laser radiation would allow the beam direction determination.

The approach is digital but not iterative, and requires as input data but two short-exposure intensity images, without the need for reference point sources. By taking the Fourier transform of each image and dividing, a set of linear equations is generated whose unknowns are sampled values of the two random point spread functions that degraded the images. An oversampling by 50% in Fourier space equalizes the number of unknowns and independent equations. With some prior knowledge of spread function support, and in the absence of added noise of image detection, the inverted equations give exact solutions. The two observed images are then inverse filtered to reconstruct the object.},

The spectral index of the dust emission for these sources has been determined solely within the 30-GHz wide 350-GHz (850 ---m) passband to an accuracy comparable to those determined through multiwavelength observations. We find an average 1.6, in agreement with spectral indices determined from previous submillimetre observations of these sources and with those determined for HMC in general. The largest single source of uncertainty in these results is the variability of the atmosphere at 350 GHz, and with better sky subtraction techniques we show that the dust spectral index can clearly be determined within one passband to high accuracy with a submillimetre FTS. Using an imaging FTS on the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA)-2, the next generation wide-field submillimetre camera currently under development to replace SCUBA at the JCMT in 2006, we calculate that at 350 GHz it will be possible to determine to ---0.1 for sources as faint as 400 mJy beam-1 and to ---0.3 for sources as faint as 140 mJy beam-1 .

The ambient surroundings near the flames were assumed to be homogeneous with the total pressure being fixed at one atmosphere. Atmospheric C02 concentrations were held constant at 0.04 kPa and the water vapor concentrations varied between 0.55-5.63 kPa based on temperature and relative humidity. The remaining partial pressures were accounted for by O2 and N2. Correlations to estimate atmospheric attenuation are given over a range of conditions that include path length (10-200m), ambient temperature (19-35 deg C), source temperature (1000-1600 degC) and relative humidity (0.25-1 .O) as parameters. The results of these calculations indicate that, over this range of conditions, the radiant flux can be attenuated by as much as 42%. 0 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Recent climate studies have proven that both temperature and CO2 content of the earth's atmosphere followed a regular 100,000-year cycle of change and that they are closely correlated. Moreover, the observed increase of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeds the predicted values extrapolated from historical data. Other than industrialization and rapid urbanization, geo-natural hazards such as leakage from hydrocarbon reservoirs and spontaneous combustion of coal contribute a considerable amount of CO2 to the atmosphere. Several researchers have studied the possibilities and reliabilities of atmospheric CO2 retrieval by the point-based method (nearly accurate but much localized) and globally (wider observation but many uncertainties). Radiative transfer codes, such as FASCOD (Fast Atmospheric Signature Code) with the HITRAN (High-Resolution Transmission) spectral database can simulate atmospheric transmission and path radiance with customized gas composition (CO2, water vapour, CO, etc.) and concentration in order to understand the phenomena in a specific wavelength region. In the present study, a number of atmospheric models were constructed with different CO2 concentrations (ppmv) with a combination of water vapour and other atmospheric gases such as CO, CH4, N2O, SO2, etc., to find out the interference patterns of these gases over CO2 absorption bands. The transmission features of these gas combinations were analysed by partial least-squares regression models. These models show that the most suitable CO2 absorption bands are located around 2 mm, such as 1.998 and 2.001 mm. The spectral information derived from different concentrations of CO2 can be fitted in multivariate models to predict the CO2 concentration from spectral information in a controlled environment. Furthermore, the present study explores the sensitivity of some available remote sensing sensors in variable CO2 concentrations for use in real world.},

  abstract  = {An intercomparison of radiative transfer models (RTM) with specific application to NOAA-12 channel 12 (6.7 micron) was recently carried out under GVaP (GEWEX Global Water Vapor Project, Soden et al, submitted to BAMS, 1999). At the ITSC- 10 1999 meeting in Boulder, the working group on radiative transfer proposed to extend this intercomparison to several HIRS and AMSU channels, with a special focus on the Jacobian intercomparison. This activity is formally organized here. The Jacobian of a RTM expresses the derivative of brightness temperature (Tb) with respect to model state variables influencing the RTE, such as temperature, T, specific humidity, Q, surface skin temperature, Ts, and pressure, Ps. The Jacobian is a fundamental quantity required for the direct assimilation of radiances. Physically, the Jacobian is similar to the so-called weighting function which is the derivative of total transmittance with pressure. However it is more specific because it expresses separately the sensitivity to T, Q, Ps or Ts. In numerical weather prediction (NWP), Jacobians are computed by a routine referred to as the Jacobian or gradient routine. Analysis increments in NWP will differ if the RTM and Jacobians differ. The GVaP experience mentioned above has already indicated significant differences in Jacobians of several RTMs. This intercomparison will explore this issue in detail along with a standard forward Tb validation. This invitation is addressed to anyone who wishes to test a particular RTM. Many, in fact most RTMs do not have an accompanying Jacobian routine. However Jacobians can easily be evaluated by brute force from imposed perturbations to input profiles of the RTM.},

  Abstract                 = {A primary target acquisition threat to ground vehicle systems is the human observer whose psychovisual capabilities are a critical element in the simulation of these phenomena. This paper discusses the Army's performance assessment methodology for determining signature countermeasures tradeoffs and the human factors elements essential for this type of analysis. Current Army acquisition models use a very simplistic model of the human visual perception system. The minimum resolvable contrast (MRC) models, for example, consider the target as an equivalent rectangle in a uniform background scene. The criteria for detection, recognition and identification are defined in terms of the number of line pairs across a critical target dimension. Although this simple model is convenient for many battlefield effectiveness simulations; the level of detail is insufficient for most CM applications. Several examples will illustrate the limitations of current target acquisition methodology for visual signature assessment and evaluation. A detailed description of the target/background scene and the observer psychovisual characteristics is essential for a robust simulation of these processes. In particular color, motion, shape, texture, search and clutter are essential parameters in any CM performance assessment methodology. The inclusion of these elements into future target acquisition models is the focal point for this discussion.},

  Abstract                 = {Target acquisition methodology for infrared (IR) and visual man-in-the-loop imaging sensors has several limitations for many sensor performance assessment applications. Recent advances in computational vision modeling (CVM) have made dramatic improvements in the understanding of early human vision processes. A simple model of neural receptive fields consists of a generic image representation of the spatial processing characteristics for early vision cortical areas. The input image is first divided into its three color opponent components with each axis further decomposed into a set of band pass spatial frequency filters with different center frequencies and orientations. The spatial frequency decomposition is accomplished by an efficient encoding algorithm incorporating a hierarchical cascading Gaussian pyramid algorithm which is an alternating sequence of image output passing through Nyquist low pass spatial filter and subsampling local operators for image encoding. This paper examines the limitations of earlier target acquisition models and describes a computational model which starts with actual stimulus images as an input. It predicts human performance of experimental tasks by attaching a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to each spatial frequency channel, and then uses a combining function to define a composite d' parameter for a signal detection theory calculation of probabilities of detection and false alarm. Several examples of the model are applied to various detection applications.},

The AVS program will include the development, integration, and evaluation of technologies pertaining to precision video registration, multiple target surveillance, and automated activity monitoring into a system capable of real-time UAV video exploitation. When combined with existing EO and IR target recognition algorithms, AVS will provide the Warfighter with a comprehensive video battlespace awareness capability.},

This note suggests corrections which should be made to the HITRAN line intensities of various water bands in this region to achieve compliance with the measured intensities. A correction which increases the intensities by 8-14% should be applied in the 9500-12,861 cm-1 region. The correction decreases the line intensities in the 8036-9482 and 13,200-22,657 cm-1 intervals. The correction factor is exp[-E(2hc/k)(1/T -1/T')] in these regions, where T296 K and T' is the measurement temperature. This correction becomes significant at higher values of E; it decreases the line intensities in HITRAN by about 19% at E"=1400 cm-1. },

At some later time t<sub>1</sub> the target group is again observed by a missile seeker. The targets are assumed to move as a group, as well as individually, between observation times and so have a dependent motion model. The detection probability at t<sub>1</sub> is less than one, and so some of the targets may not be detected. It is also possible that some measurements received at t<sub>1</sub> may not originate from targets. The problem is to estimate the state of the designated target at time t<sub>1</sub>, given the two sets of measurements, i.e., to recover the designated target. We employ a dependent target motion model within a multiple hypothesis framework. The motion of the targets is modeled as the result of two effects: a bulk component, which is common to all targets, and an individual contribution, which is independent from target to target. A closed-form solution is derived for the linear-Gaussian special case, and simulation examples illustrating the technique are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Many of the standard considerations for the modeling of infrared target acquisition of stationary targets in a single field of view must be altered when considering target acquisition in the actual battlefield. Sensors are scanning, targets are moving, and a complex background is present. A metric is needed to determine acquisition efficacy which is considerably more complex than the standard analysis. In this paper, we will discuss several of the issues involved. The use of a single detectable frequency to model the target acquisition process is not sufficient. We consider the replacement of this model with one consisting of an integral of the target spectrum, taking into account the spatial frequency modulation transfer function dependence of the imaging system. Psychophysical experiments are presented; the results of this experiment verify our approach that the maximum spatial frequency criterion is not sufficient to determine the target acquisition probability.},

  Abstract                 = {This ia a progress report; we define the requirements and details of the latest design of the Gemini Adaptive Optics System (GAOS). The specifications flow from those astronomy programs needing AO for which Gemini will be best remembered. Based on a critical list of astronomical projects and ignoring those likely to be completed earlier by other ground or space telescopes, the astronomers set requirements for image quality, corrected field of view and sky coverage probability. In median seeing (r<sub>o</sub> equals 25 cm) we require the signal to noise ratio with GAOS be double that achieved without it, using only tip/tilt/fast-focus of the secondary mirror. Our design is unique because the specifications are for end-to-end image quality delivered to the detector of an instrument while maximizing sky coverage. The error budget includes both telescope errors and instrument effects, with only about one third of the total for the residual uncorrected atmospheric errors, traditionally the only ones considered in papers on adaptive optics.},

This model was then validated using an air-filled gas cell at room temperaturewith path length 15 cm. Quantitative measurements of the temperature and pressure within the cell reveal a that pressure measurements are accurate to within 15 Torr (0.3 PSI), while the temperature is systematically over-predicted by 20 K. The standard deviation in the pressure measurements was found to be 9.3 Torr (0.18 PSI) at 770 Torr (14.9 PSI), while for the temperature measurements it was 1.2 K at 298 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Smoke and dust clouds are often more easily detected than the sources producing the clouds. Long range detection depends on the cloud's size and contrast against its background. However, a cloud can sometimes be detected, even in low average contrast conditions, if it significantly masks the apparent clutter of its background or if it provides sufficiently different clutter itself. This paper investigates a basic cloud detection method that includes both cloud contrast and background clutter. It is assumed that the sensor minimum resolvable contrast (or thermal temperature difference) as a function of spatial frequencies is known. This is used to define a detection threshold. We consider contrast in mean intensity, changes in the width of the background intensity histogram, changes in edge strength, and comparison of spatial frequency content as methods to detect the cloud relative to its background. Methods are examined using measured and simulated images.},

The Static and Dynamic probabilities of detection predicted by the model represent the expected performance achieved with a given sensor with regards to sensor characteristics, target signature, background clutter, and human observer psychophysics effects. This paper will address the methodology of FTAM's prediction method and present comparisons to the U.S. Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensor Directorate (NVESD) ACQUIRE 1.0 Range Performance Model for Target Acquisition Systems.

The flammability limits of ultra-dilute n-butane/air mixtures are calculated over ranges of temperature, pressure, and dilution levels relevant to HCCI operation. The results suggest that with the elevated temperatures required to achieve HCCI combustion the in-cylinder charge is capable of supporting a propagating flame over most of the HCCI operating regime. However, under light-load and idle conditions the dilution levels are too large and the spark has no effect on HCCI combustion. Thus, some other mechanism must be found to control combustion phasing under these conditions. Since the true eigenvalue for the flame propagation calculation is the mass burning rate and not the flame speed, these results demonstrate that using an arbitrary flame speed cut-off criteria for determining the dilution limit significantly underestimates the actual flammability ranges. 2003 The Combustion Institute.

  Abstract                 = {There is a widespread requirement for wide area surveillance with target detection and recognition. To achieve the above aims with a single sensor is difficult and inevitably performance compromises have to be made. A system, designated Firefly, has been developed which splits the task of surveillance/target detection from that of recognition. Firefly uses separate sensors for both tasks, each sensor can then be optimized for the role it has to perform For surveillance and target detection, Firefly makes use of a previously developed scanned thermal imager operating in the 8 - 11 micrometer waveband. There was no suitable sensor available for the recognition role and so a 3 - 5 micrometer imager based on a 2D starring array was developed for this purpose. The Firefly system is described in this paper with emphasis being given to a description of the high resolution, recognition sensor where the development effort was concentrated. Results of performance also are given.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the e?ect of atmospheric optical turbulence on ultraviolet (UV) radiation with a wavelength of 253.7 nm. The normalized irradiance variance (scintillation index) was measured using a UV scintillometer with a path length of 185 m. The dependence of the UV scintillations on the atmospheric turbulence structure parameter and inner scale was determined through simultaneous measurements of these quantities made with a visible laser scintillometer. The dependence of the UV scintillation index and its probability density function on receiver aperture size was also measured. It was found that the scintillation predicted by currently available models which take into account the e?ects of inner scale, saturation and aperture averaging was in good agreement with the measurements made under various conditions in weak turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in the modeling of human observers using infrared and electro-optic sensors have provided remarkable accuracy in predicting performance. These advances center on a deeper understanding of the psychophysics involved in the target acquisition process. New insights into the role of noise as a limiter of sensor performance have resulted. A complete theory of target acquisition performance developed by Vollmerhausen et. al., is reviewed. A central element of this theory is the notion of minimum resolvable temperature (MRT) or minimum resolvable contrast (MRC). These functions can be subsumed under the idea of threshold vision. A general equation for threshold vision of an observer using an electro-optic sensor is presented. The relationship between threshold vision and MRT/MRC is shown. Channel models for the human perception are used to derive mathematical models for noise incorporating both the temporal and spatial response of the observer. The impact of noise found in electro-optical sensors on the threshold vision function and the target acquisition task is shown. The implications of the theory on laboratory characterization of sensors are explored. Future expansions of this theory are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional FLIR performance analysis uses analytic models to predict sensor performance characteristics such as modulation transfer function (MTF) and minimum resolvable temperature (MRT). These characteristics are then used in conjunction with empirical criterion such as the Johnson cycle criteria to predict the performance of observers using the modeled sensor. In general, such an analysis suffers from inadequate descriptions of the effects of the background and incomplete descriptions of the observer detection mechanism. Accurate predictions of field performance in a particular setting require the expensive collection of imagery for metric analysis or perception tests. In this paper, an image-based approach is investigated. Using an advanced FLIR simulation, synthetic image sets are generated under controlled conditions. Using these image sets, image metrics are calculated and predictions of target detectability are made using a contrast-to-clutter model and a computational vision model. These predictions are compared to results obtained using a traditional range performance analysis from the MRT based ACQUIRE model. An assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the image-based approach is given.},

  abstract  = {At room temperature, CO2 is transparent in the ultraviolet (UV) at wavelengths longer than 205 nm; however, at temperatures above 1000 K the CO2 absorption cross-section becomes significant in the region between 200 and 320 nm. Because CO2 is a major product of hydrocarbon combustion and because both the magnitude of the absorption cross-section and the shape of the UV absorption spectrum vary strongly with temperature, measurements of UV optical absorption spectra offer the potential to infer gas temperature in combustion systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the first use of UV absorption measurements to determine temperature using five different experimental examples to illustrate the utility in hydrocarbon combustion applications of this new temperature diagnostic strategy. (1) Transmission measurements of cw laser light at 266 nm are used to determine time-resolved temperature in shock-heated CO2. (2) Similar transmission measurements are used to infer time-resolved temperature behind a detonation wave in a pulse-detonation engine using absorption from equilibrium concentrations of the CO2 combustion product. (3) The absorption of pulsed laser light near 226 nm is used to infer temperature in the burned gases of a premixed high-pressure methane flame. (4) Wavelength-resolved absorption of light from a broadband UV deuterium lamp is time-resolved with a kinetic spectrograph to acquire time-resolved absorption spectra illustrating the measurement of temperature in a system with changing temperature and CO2 mole fraction. (5) Time-gated, spectrally resolved transmission of a deuterium lamp is used to derive temperature at specific crank angles in a piston engine. These examples demonstrate that temperature measurements based on UV optical absorption of CO2 have good potential for use in a wide variety of hydrocarbon combustion applications. },

  Abstract                 = {For years there has been a dichotomy within the test community about imaging sensor resolution figures of merit; one camp favoring the modulation transfer function (MTF) while the other prefers the minimum resolvable contrast (MRC). This presentation will attempts to bridge the gap between these two test approaches and describe how rigorous mathematical techniques might be applied to test data reduction in order to streamline the test process. We can superimpose the MTF and normalized noise curves into one 3 dimensional graph. Through Fourier and statistical analysis, a streamlined test approach and objective analysis is now possible. The potential for repeatability and cost savings can be realized through a two phased test procedure which anticipates these powerful analysis tools.},

One system is the Surveillance and Television Recording (STAR) System. This system is a dual camera high capability unit which is expected to replace the current IAEA systems as time progresses. Another is the MINISTAR which is a much smaller, single camera unit which incorporates recent technology advances, and retains many of the basis STAR features at a considerably lower cost. Beyond these near-term advances, it is expected that video camera and recording technology will soon be available which will make video systems competitive with the film camera systems.},

Just as color appearance modeling evolved from traditional colorimetry and color difference calculations, image appearance modeling evolves from color image difference calculations. A modular framework for the creation of a color image difference metric has been developed and tested using several psychophysical datasets. This framework is based upon traditional CIE color difference equations, and the S-CIELAB spatial extension to the CIELAB color space. The color image difference predictions have been shown to correlate well with experimental data. The color image difference framework was extended predict the overall appearance of images by replacing the CIELAB color space at the heart of the calculations with a color appearance space. An image appearance model maps the physics of complex image stimuli into human perceptions such as lightness, chroma, hue, contrast, sharpness, and graininess. A first generation image appearance model, named iCAM, has been introduced. Through image appearance modeling new techniques for predicting overall image quality, without the need for intimate knowledge of the imaging system design, can be born.},

It has recently been demonstrated that high-resolution optical wave-front distortion suppression can be achieved using feedback systems based on high-resolution spatial light modulators and phase-contrast techniques. We examine the modeling and analysis of such adaptive optic systems, and show that under certain conditions, the nonlinear dynamical system models obtained are gradient systems (with energy functions that also serve as Lyapunov functions). These gradient systems (employing fixed phase-contrast sensors) serve as a starting point for understanding the design of practical high-resolution wave-front correction systems, in which the phase-contrast sensor itself is subject to control.},

  abstract  = {Infrared (IR) planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) techniques for imaging of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are reported. These diagnostics employ a tunable IR source to excite overtone and combination band transitions of CO and CO2, respectively, and one or two InSb focal plane arrays to collect fluorescence emitted via fundamental transitions from excited vibrational states. A brief outline of the theoretical framework for absorption and fluorescence modeling is presented, with most attention paid to the distinct characteristics stemming from the use of vibrational (IR) transitions as compared to more traditional electronic (UV) transitions. Of note are the conclusions that (1) acceptable fluorescence quantum yield (and therefore signal level) can be achieved despite relatively small Einstein A coefficients, as the quenching processes following IR excitation are often slow; and (2) vibration-to-vibration transfer to other IR-active species can enable imaging of more than one species with a single excitation wavelength. Experimentally, the large dynamic range afforded by the IR cameras (14 bit) allows for effective imaging despite the presence of background luminosity, while the use of two cameras enables imaging of multiple species simultaneously and/or common-mode rejection of luminous background in unsteady flows. PLIF imaging of CO and CO2 is demonstrated for room-temperature mixing processes with signal-to-noise ratio 1 detection limits near 1000 ppm. Imaging of both CO and CO2 in a steady laminar coflowing CO/Ar/ H2 flame is also presented using laser excitation of CO only.},

The principle of aperture sounding consists in the following: the probe distortions of radiated wave front are produced; the light power on the target is analyzed and the distortions are determined which increase the light flux density, these distortions are added to the wave front, and the iterative process lasts until the maximum flux density is achieved. The expressions have been derived which allow to propose the algorithm of aperture system control. The algorithm, compensated for the phase distortions of a source, is presented.},

The OPTRAN coefficients have been generated for a wide range of satellites and instruments. The most significant new development is the Jacobian-K-matrix version of OPTRAN, which is currently used for operational direct radiance assimilation in both the Global Data Analysis System and the ETA Data Analysis System at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction Environmental Modeling Center. This paper documents these improvements and serves as a record of the current status of the operational OPTRAN code.},

Concepts considered are atmospheric attenuation versus atmospheric blur, and contrast limited (blur-limited) versus noise limited imaging. Results indicate that the role of the atmosphere in target acquisition is blur rather than attenuation, and that for ranges on the order of a kilometer or more target acquisition is limited by atmospheric blur rather than by hardware. A significant portion of the atmospheric blur derives from small angle forward scattering by aerosols, which actually increases measured temperature differences for ranges up to a few kilometers.},

  Abstract                 = {We focus on modeled atmospheric and image restoration effects on the human acquisition of a target. The Image restoration is by filtering atmospheric effects, such as blur caused by absorption, scattering from aerosols, and distortion caused by turbulence that changes the wave front angle, moves the image on the image plane, and blurs it. The restoration method using an atmospheric wiener filter is intended to correct the atmospheric effects. This filter is based on the fact that the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the turbulence is composed of a mean value and a random component while the aerosol MTF changes slowly. The atmospheric wiener filter is more advantageous than an ordinary wiener filter in high turbulence situations. Using the atmospheric wiener filter, we consider the target acquisition limitations of the filter through perception experiments and statistical analysis of the results. We found that the atmospheric wiener filter can noticeably improve target acquisition probability at low noise levels. As the noise increases, however, the improvement becomes more limited because the restoration increases the noise level in the image. &copy; 2003 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

  Abstract                 = {A new direction for the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate is the development of ultra-narrow field of view (UNFOV) infrared target acquisition (TA) systems. Frequently, the performance of these systems is limited by atmospheric turbulence in the imaging path. It is desirable to include the effects of atmospheric turbulence blur in infrared TA models. The current TA models are currently linear shift invariant (LSI) systems with component modulation transfer functions (MTFs). The use of additional MTFs, to account for atmospheric turbulence, requires that the turbulence blur have LSI properties. The primary unresolved issue with the treatment of turbulence blur as an MTF is the LSI characteristics of the blur. Significant variation in spatial blur and temporal blur prohibit the use of a single MTF in an LSI target acquisition model. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University (BGU) use a TA model that includes an LSI blur, which is a temporal average of the turbulence blur. The research described here evaluates the BGU-type treatment of atmospheric MTF and determines it reasonable for inclusion in the US Army's TA model. In addition to the spatial characteristics, the temporal variation of the turbulence blur is also described. &copy; 2001 society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of ultra-narrow field of view (UNFOV) infrared target acquisition (TA) systems, and the development of range-gated laser illuminated short-wave infrared (SWIR) imagers has increased the importance of accounting for atmospheric affects in TA models. The performance of these systems are frequently limited by the atmosphere, instead of the camera resolution or sensitivity characteristics. First generation and second generation FLIRs were less susceptible to atmospheric limitations due both to their standard operating method and relative lower resolution. The approach taken to the atmosphere's contribution to TA modeling has been incremental and systematic. The current TA model, NVTherm, includes signal attenuation by the atmosphere. The fidelity of this model has been improved by adding a MODTRAN module and calculation of spectrally weighted transmissions. The Fall 2001 release of the model will include a linear shift invariant (LSI) MTF for atmospheric turbulence blur that was verified from field-testing last year. Additionally, it will include the effects of turbulence distortion on observer performance developed from perception experiments conducted this month. This paper discusses the model's atmospheric components, past efforts to validate a turbulence blur model, current efforts to model turbulence distortion effects, and intended future work to include additional atmospheric effects.},

For applications in which one is interested mainly in evaluating the effective absorption in a microwindow, a computationally less expensive method has been developed. The method is faster than the explicit line-by-line calculation by a factor proportional to the number of line wings that contribute to the absorption in the simulated microwindow. This paper presents the method and demonstrates its performances in the 700---1400 cm{\`A}1 infrared band. Typically one obtains a gain in computation time of order 25. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These algorithms identify targets, based on the features of the various objects  in the missile's field of view. In this article, we propose a fast target recognition  system. We describe the characteristics of the images that the image processing module of this seeker and tracker extracts from the infrared video frames and show how to construct from these translation and rotation invariant features that can be used as input to the neural network. We determine the individual discriminating power of these features by constructing their histograms, which allows us to eliminate some as not being useful for our purpose. Finally, by testing our system on real data, we show that it has a 90\% success rate in aircraft-flare identification, and a processing time that during this time, the aircrafts and missiles will have traveled only a few millimetres. Most of the images on which the neural network makes its mistakes are seen to be hard to recognize  even by a human expert.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective characterization of electro-optical sensors and that of image enhancement techniques has always been a difficult task. Up to now the sensor is characterized using the minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) or the minimum resolvable contrast (MRC). The performance of image enhancement techniques is done by visual inspection by a human observer. Since in more and more cameras some kind of image processing is applied, a more elaborate test is needed that can measure the performance of the combination of the sensor and the image processing. A good candidate is the TOD (Triangle Orientation Discrimination) method, which is developed as an alternative for MRTD and the MRC methods. We are investigating how the standard TOD-method can be extended to cameras with image processing and whether these measurements can be automated. An algorithm is under development, which is based on the TOD-method and predicts the characterization by human observers of camera-system performances. The algorithm combines the TOD-method, an early-vision model, and an orientation discriminator. The algorithm uses the same images as used in human-observer experiments. After correction for the physical properties of the display and the human eye, the algorithm tries to find the orientation of the stimulus. The algorithm can also predict the performance of only image processing using a simple scene-generator in stead of a camera setup.},

Measuring these aberrations, including the high order ones, is possible using wavefront sensing techniques. A review of the rapid progress in this field is given. Once the aberrations are known, adaptive optics methods, developed for astronomical observing in the past 15 years, can be applied in order either to improve retinal imaging or to give hyper-vision to the subject. Progress in this domain is reviewed, and some original results are reported with a new instrument. Future applications are discussed, including a possible three-dimensional, high-resolution method to image the human retina in vivo.},

In particular, I explain the crucial distinction between the ``coordinates of the time-derivative of a vector'' and the ``time-derivative of the coordinates of a vector''. I finish by drawing a parallel between this aerospace language and the notation found in seemingly unrelated areas such as relativity theory and fluid dynamics, and make some comments on various supposedly different derivatives as found in the literature.},

Ground-based observations can only represent a very small area and surface albedo often varies greatly at small spatial scales and throughout the different seasons (Ohmura and Gilgen 1993). For modeling and remote sensing studies, areal-mean surface albedo representative of an area comparable to a model grid or a satellite pixel is needed. The vegetative land cover surrounding the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Central Facility (CF) site is so variable that point-wise measurements of surface albedo do not provide reliable surface albedo data.},

Older adults were found to have greater spatial variability of submovement endpoints for higher submovement velocities. This elevated motor noise is considered to be a primary cause of their slower performance. Supplementary auditory displays of the subjects' own position or velocity did not improve performance, which suggests that perceptual noise in this task is not a primary limiting factor. Older adults exhibited a repetition effect while younger adults exhibited a contrast effect when performing sequences of varied movements. This difference suggests that older adults may plan their movements individually, while younger adults plan a sequence of movements.},

  Abstract                 = {One ofthe most important objectives ofmilitary intelligence is to warn ofpotential or immediate threats. This paper investigates several related research issues. First, what kinds ofdata can military space provide, with which to watch, monitor, and analyze hostile forces? Second, what operational mechanisms can work to integrate military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance? Third, how can a system architecture in support ofintelligence operations be implemented for decision support and knowledge management? The paper investigates how research work can contribute a system concept with military space applications to national defense and security. It investigates the use of a geographical information system as a system platform for integrating the spatial database, attribute database, rule base, case base and knowledge repository as a knowledge-based decision support system. A hypothetical case showing how the system is implemented is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the design, implementation and performance of an integrated Hartmann (-Shack) wavefront sensor suitable for real-time operation and compatible with standard CMOS technology.A wavefront sensor can be used to detect distortions in the profile of a light beam or indirectly in that of an optical component. Such a sensor can also be coupled to a deformable mirror to enable the compensation of the detected distortions in a light beam. These adaptive optical systems find more and more applications in astronomy, industry and have recently been introduced in medical setups.We use the Hartmann wavefront-sensing method, in which a light beam is sampled into a number of sub-beams, which are projected on a plane. The displacements of the light spots on this plane are used to estimate the profile of the associated arbitrary wavefront. Usually, a conventional image sensor registers the light spots and an image-processing algorithm computes their displacements from a reference grid. However, this approach restricts the operational speed of the sensor because it relies on the frame-transfer rate of the imager and on the rather slow data-reduction algorithm.The novel contribution of this work is that, to render faster operation, we introduce a Hartmann wavefront sensor that uses an addressable matrix of CMOS integrated position-sensitive detectors, namely quad cells. Each sampled light spot is associated with a quad cell such that direct information about the spot-centroid displacement is available.Each particular application has its own requirements and the developed sensor, which should be used with light sources in the visible spectrum, shall perform well for applications involving enough light (>0.5 mW beams), and there where lower-order wavefront aberrations are expected (<30 Zernike terms). However, this sensor can be modified in a variety of ways to attend to particular applications. The fabricated sensor allows operation at rates higher than 3 kHz.},

  abstract  = {The absorption spectrum of natural water vapour around 1.5 lm has been recorded with a typical sensitivity of 5 {\^A} 10{\`A}10 cm{\`A}1 by using a CW-cavity ring down spectroscopy set up based on fibred DFB lasers. A series of 31 DFB lasers has allowed a full coverage of the 6130.8---6748.5 cm{\`A}1 (1.63---1.48 lm) region corresponding to the H transparency band of the atmosphere. The line parameters (wavenumber and intensity) of a total of 5190 lines, including 4247 lines of water vapor, were derived by a one by one fit of the lines to a Voigt profile. Different isotopologues of water (H2 16 O, H2 18 O, H2 17 O, and HD16 O) present in natural abundance in the sample contribute to the spectrum. For the main isotopologue, H2 16 O, 2130 lines were measured with line intensities as weak as 10{\`A}29 cm/ molecule while only 926 lines (including a proportion of 30% inaccurate calculated lines) with a minimum intensity of 3 {\^A} 10{\`A}27 cm/ molecule are provided by the HITRAN and GEISA databases. Our comparison in the whole 5750---7965 cm{\`A}1 region, has also evidenced that an error in the process of conversion of the intensity units from cm{\`A}2 /atm to cm{\`A}1 /(molecule {\^A} cm{\`A}2 ) at 296 K, has led to H2 16 O line intensities values listed in the HITRAN-2000 database, systematically 8 % below the original FTS values. The rovibrational assignment was performed on the basis of the ab initio calculations by Schwenke and Partridge with a subsequent refinement and validation using the Ritz combination principle together with all previously measured water transitions relevant to this study. This procedure allowed determining 172, 139, 71, and 115 new energy levels for the H2 16 O, H2 18 O, H2 17 O, and HD16 O isotopologues, respectively. The results are compared with the available databases and discussed in regard of previous investigations by Fourier transform spectroscopy. The spectrum analysis has showed that most of the transitions which cannot be assigned to water are very weak and are due to impurities such as carbon dioxide and ammonia, leaving only about 3% of the observed transitions unassigned. The interest of a detailed knowledge of water absorption for trace detectors developed in the 1.5 lm range is underlined: for instance HDO contributes significantly to the considered spectrum while no HDO line parameters are provided by the HITRAN database. {\'O} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Target acquisition tasks in natural environments are often augmented by cuing systems that advise human observers during the decision process. With present technological limitations, cuing systems are imperfect, so the question arises whether cuing aids should be implemented under all conditions. We examined target acquisition performance under different levels of task complexity and cuing system reliability. We introduce here two new methods to help define observer behavior trends in cued target acquisition: a quantitative measure of observer search behavior in a temporal sense and a measure of the extent of observer reliance on the cue. We found that observer reliance on the cue correlated with task difficulty and the perceived reliability of the cue. Cuing was generally helpful in complex tasks, whereas cuing reduced performance in easy tasks. Consequently, cuing systems should be implemented only when the task is difficult enough to warrant the intrusion of a cue into the task. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design and implementation of imperfect automated aids dealing with augmented reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Target acquisition in military and industrial settings is often augmented by a cueing system, whereby a computer gives advice that can be accepted or rejected by the human observer. Two human actors issues involved with the use of such cuers are: 1) how to present the cue to the observer, and 2) to what degree will the observer use or rely upon the provided information, particularly in cases where the cuer is not wholly reliable. In this paper, we consider both of these issues. Infrared military-type images that were overlaid with cues to suggest target presence were presented to six groups of observers. The observers were informed that the cues were not always correct. We presented several different cue interfaces to our observers. When questioned, the observers indicated a preference for particular cue types. Overall, the observers' opinions about the cue types were reflected in their acquisition results. Observer performance was higher when cued than when not cued. Although the cues were effective, different cue reliability levels did not influence the results to a large degree.},

the civil aircraft profile of flight, and will be able to defeat MANPADS of first and second generation
(currently the most available world-wide) and also of third generation which may become a threat in the
future.
Through a three-year project, CASAM explores several technological breakthroughs in laser, optics,
electro mechanics and processing that will be the core of the future competitive equipment. Specific effort
is put on threat analysis and simulation, economical analysis, aircraft installation constraints and impact.
A specific study is being carried out on legal and regulation issues which have a prominent position in the

A particular focus is on the evolution of the ozone layer and chemical constituents and other parameters that are strongly related to the evolution of stratospheric ozone or climate, like the spectral UV irradiance, the aerosol load, and parameters of dynamical or meteorological nature. Enhancing the capabilities to make distinctive studies in the troposphere and stratosphere has been among the particular objectives of the project. ESACII also aimed at a better integration between model and observational information. The research approach has consisted of a combination of high-quality field observations, including continued long-term monitoring and campaign observation, new advanced data analyses and geophysical studies, and supporting laboratory measurements of fundamental spectroscopic parameters of atmospheric molecules. The monitoring stations involved are Ukkel (50.5N, 4---E), Harestua (Norway, 60N, 11E) and the primary alpine station of the NDSC (Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change) comprising Jungfraujoch (46.5N, 8E) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP, 44N, 6E). Harestua is a complementary station of the NDSC; Ukkel acquired this status in the course of the project. New measurements have been initiated at Ile de La Runion. The experimental techniques deployed in the project are spectral UV radiometry, UV-Visible zenith sky and off-axis DOAS spectrometry, high-resolution Fourier-transform spectrometry, Brewer and Dobson photometry as well as ozone soundings.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive optics are regularly used in ground-based astronomical telescopes. These applications are characterized by a very narrow ( [similar to] 1 arcmin) field of view. For economic reasons, commercial space-based earth-observing optical systems must have a field of view as large as possible. We develop a new error function that is an extension of conventional adaptive optics for wide field-of-view optical systems and show that this new error function enables diffraction-limited performance across a large field of view with only one deformable mirror. This new error function allows for reprogramming of aberration control algorithms for particular applications by the use of an addressable weighting function. &copy; 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

Incident beams were oriented 10 and 60 deg from normal. Forward-scatter (key to baffles and cold shields) data are presented for infrared black surface preparations, including: anodizing, copper oxide, nickel oxide, black paints, and trademarked black surfaces. Comparison is also made between selected surfaces before and after exposure to 78 K (LN2) thermal cycles. This work also includes scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) measurements for selected black surfaces, including comparisons of damaged and undamaged nickel oxide},

In this case an analytical representation in terms of Gaussians may give better results. We have made a study of properties of Gaussians in fitting wavefronts. We analyzed an specific array of Gaussian functions and show their easy Fourier transformation. In Fourier space some criteria are proposed for setting the Gaussian width, the separation between these functions and making an estimation of the wavefront fitting error. Two simulated wavefronts are fitted and a comparison with a Zernike polynomial is made. It is well known that when fitting using Zernike polynomials one needs to find the optimal number of terms beyond which the errors in the approximation become larger. We show that using Gaussians the accuracy of the fit increases with the number of terms. We demonstrate some interesting properties, such as their facility to fit local deformations and fast parameter determination.},

  abstract  = {Temperature (200---300 K) and pressure (70---200 atm) dependent laboratory measurements of infrared transmission by CO2 N2 mixtures have been made. From these experiments the absorption coe cient is reconstructed, over a range of several orders of magnitude, between 600 and 1000 cm-1 . The elevated densities used in the experiments (up to 200 atm) magnify the contribution of the wings of the 2 band lines. In order to analyze the spectra, a theoretical model based on the energy corrected sudden approximation is proposed which accounts for line-mixing e ects within the impact approximation. This approach uses the model and associated parameters built previously to model Q branches (JQSRT 1999;61:153) but extends it by now including all P, Q, and R lines. No adjustable parameters are used and fundamental properties of the collisional relaxation operator are verified by using a renormalization procedure. Comparisons between measured and calculated spectra confirm that neglecting line-mixing (Lorentzian model) leads to an overestimation of absorption by up to three orders of magnitude in the far wings. On the other hand, the proposed approach leads to satisfactory results both in regions dominated by contributions of local lines and in the wing: measured spectra are correctly modeled over a range where absorption varies by more than four orders of magnitude. The largest discrepancies, which appear about 150 cm-1 from the 2 center, can be due to ignite duration of collisions effects or to uncertainties in the experimental determination of very weak absorption.},

  abstract  = {A theoretical model for the prediction of CO2 absorption in both central and wing regions of infrared absorption bands was presented in the companion paper I. It correctly accounts for line-mixing e ects and was validated by comparisons with laboratory spectra in the 600---1000 cm-1 region. This quality was confirmed using atmospheric transmissions measured by solar occultation experiments in the second paper. The present work completes these studies by now considering atmospheric emission in the 10---20 m range. Comparisons are made between computed atmospheric radiances and measurements obtained using four different Fourier transform experiments collecting spectra for nadir, up-looking, as well as limb (from balloon and satellite) geometries. Our results con---rm that using a Voigt model can lead to very large errors that a ect the spectrum more than 300 cm-1 away from the center of the CO2 2 band. They also demonstrate the capability of our model to represent accurately the radiances in the entire region for a variety of atmospheric paths. This success opens interesting perspectives for the sounding of pressure and temperature profiles, particularly at low altitudes. Another benefit of the quality of the model should be an increased accuracy in the retrieval of atmospheric state parameters from broad features in the measured spectra (clouds, aerosols, heavy trace gases). ? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

They also demonstrate the capability of our model to represent accurately the absorption in the entire region for a variety of atmospheric paths. Among positive consequences of the quality of the model, the possibility of retrieving amounts of (heavy) trace gases with weak and broad absorption features is demonstrated. ? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {In the preceding companion papers a model, based on the impact and the Energy-Corrected Sudden approximations, was proposed for the calculation of the absorption shape of CO2 in both central and wing regions of infrared bands. It was successfully tested using laboratory measurements as well as atmospheric transmission and emission spectra in the 10---20 mm interval. In the present paper, this approach is used to generate a set of suitable parameters and FORTRAN software for the calculation of absorption by CO2 under atmospheric conditions which can be easily included in radiance/transmission computer codes. This package which includes all bands of significant contribution to atmospheric spectra, is an extension, now accounting for all P, Q, and R lines, of the tools proposed previously for Q branches only. Comparisons between balloon-borne limb emission stratospheric spectra and the results of forward calculations confirm the quality of the tools proposed. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In an airborne platform adaptive optics application, the inbound (beacon) and outbound (high-energy laser) wavefronts propagate through different regions of the atmosphere at different time instants, that is, spatial and temporal anisoplanatism cannot be neglected. Measurements in an airborne platform system are from the inbound (beacon) wavefront and therefore, the outbound, high-energy laser's wavefront phase distortion Zernike expansion coefficients must be estimated. Once the said estimates are available, these values are used by a linear quadratic regulator to drive the actuators of the deformable mirror. The controller, which consists of a Kalman filter estimator in tandem with the regulator, provides commands to the piezoelectric actuators of the deformable mirror. Thus, the estimated conjugate phase is applied to the mirror and, hence, to the outbound high-energy laser wavefront, such that at the aim point on the target, the high-energy laser wavefront distortion is minimized. In other words, the high-energy laser is correctly pointed to the aim point and the Strehl ratio is maximized. In this way, the correct deformation is applied to the deformable mirror and the benefits of adaptive optics are realized in an airborne platform application. In Part 2 of this paper, the design of the controller, that is, a Kalman filter and regulator, is addressed. The theoretical derivations are validated in extensive simulation experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved acceptance test procedure for imaging infrared (IIR) equipment has been developed to remove subjectivity, improve repeatability, and decrease the time and expense over existing methods. Traditional procedures for acceptance testing of IIR equipment require manual minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) measurements at multiple spatial frequencies with both positive and negative contrast targets. Although the manual measurement of MRTD is the standard evaluation technique used in developmental testing, it is deficient for use as an acceptance test. The main limitations are subjectivity, length of time required, and manpower (i.e., cost). The Missile Guidance Directorate (MGD) of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center has developed the automated infrared sensor test facility (AISTF) to perform automated acceptance tests and remove the subjectivity of the test procedure. The AISTF measures the modulation transfer function, noise equivalent temperature difference, 3-dimensional noise analysis, field-of-view, and non-subjective MRTD of the unit under test (UUT). The software interface for the AISTF provides an efficient means for a single test conductor to set up and conduct the test. The software controls the experiments by selecting the appropriate target, setting thermal contrast, acquiring digital imagery, and performing image analysis. Test results are provided in a detailed report and stored in a database. In addition to production line acceptance testing, the AISTF should be applicable to flight-line testing, R&amp;D analysis, and sensor characterization.},

  Abstract                 = {This project is aimed at analyzing EO/IR images to provide automatic target detection/ recognition / identification (ATR/D/I) of militarily relevant land targets. An increase in performance was accomplished using a biomimetic intelligence system functioning on low-cost, commercially available processing chips. Biomimetic intelligence has demonstrated advanced capabilities in the areas of hand-printed character recognition, real-time (30 frames per second) detection/identification of multiple faces in full 3D perspectives in cluttered environments, advanced capabilities in classification of ground-based military vehicles from synthetic aperture radar (DARPA MSTAR program), and real-time ATR/D/I of ground-based military vehicles from EO/IR/HRR data in cluttered environments. The investigation applied these tools to real data sets and examined the parameters such as the minimum resolution for target recognition, the effect of target size, rotation, line-of-sight changes, contrast, partial obscuring, background clutter etc. The results demonstrated a real-time ATR/D/I capability against a subset of militarily relevant land targets operating in a realistic scenario. Typical results on the initial EO/IR data indicate probabilities of correct classification of resolved targets to be greater than 95%.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive optics systems mitigate the atmospheric turbulence-induced distortion of a propagating light wavefront. The use of adaptive optics entails the design of a feedback controller, which requires the development of a model of the plant to be controlled. In adaptive optics, the plant consists of the atmosphere through which light is traveling. Moreover, a distinct feature of the adaptive optics control application is the presence of random signals in the plant. In optics, Zernike orthonormal polynomials are commonly used as a basis set for the expansion of wavefront phase distortions. Due to the atmospheric turbulence-induced random nature of the underlying physical process, the spatial-temporal correlation functions of the Zernike polynomial phase distortion expansion coefficients must be evaluated if a proper stochastic model of the plant is to be developed and adaptive optics is to be employed. In Part 1 of this paper, these correlation functions are developed using a layered atmospheric model and calculations for the first few low-order Zernike modes are performed. Using these correlation functions, an underlying stochastic linear dynamical system, which is adequate for control design, is synthesized. This system models the plant and, in turn, provides the basis for the employment of advanced model-based control and estimation concepts in an adaptive optics system for an airborne platform application.},

Such transforms arise, for example, in covariance matrix computations for performance modeling and evaluation of adaptive optics (AO) systems. Fast transforms are highly desirable since the parameter space for performance evaluation and optimization is large. They may be also applicable in real-time control algorithms for future AO systems. Both approaches exploit the analytical properties of the Hankel transform and result in structured matrix representations of approximate transforms. The approximations can be made to satisfy any pre-specified accuracy requirement. The matrix structures can then be exploited in subsequent computations to significantly reduce computation cost.},

To date, 6- and 8-element linear arrays and an 18-element axisymmetric array have been investigated. The system has demonstrated a convergence time of 1. 2 msec and can form the array with a strehl ratio of 0. 67. Moving glint tracking, multiple glint discrimination, and offset pointing from a fixed reference have been demonstrated. Good agreement has been observed between measured system results and theoretical predictions.},

The classical figuring and polishing techniques used so far to fabricate the pyramid are time consuming and do not guarantee uniform repeatability of the optical characteristics required for the implementation of a large number of these devices for multi-conjugated adaptive optics. We propose a new manufacturing method for the pyramid sensors using the deep X-ray lithography process, allowing very precise control of the surfaces of the components produced.

Using both line-by-line and narrowband schemes the authors look at the uncertainties in calculations of infrared irradiances, heating rates, and radiative forcing (due to changes in greenhouse gas concentration), which are due solely to uncertainties in the spectroscopic parameters of H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, and CH4 in the HITRAN database. The uncertainties in line widths are found to be more important than the uncertainties in line strengths. Spectrally integrated irradiances are estimated to be accurate to within about 0.5%, while radiative forcing values, such as those due to a doubling of CO2, are estimated to be accurate to within 5%. Uncertainties in heating rates are generally small, except in the upper stratosphere where they can reach 5%---10%. The authors also investigate the effect of changes in HITRAN between 1986 and 1996, in particular to assess the importance of updating transmittance calculations in radiative transfer schemes as spectroscopic databases are updated. Although the uncertainties in spectrally integrated quantities are small, in narrow spectral intervals the uncertainties are larger; this work does not obviate the need for further work to reduce the uncertainty in the spectroscopic parameters, nor for observational verification of radiative transfer codes.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently there has been growing interest and progress in using numerical linear algebra techniques in adaptive optics imaging control computations. Real-time adaptive optics is a means for enhancing the resolution of ground based, optical telescopes beyond the limits previously imposed by the turbulent atmosphere. An adaptive optics system automatically corrects for light distortions caused by the medium of transmission. The system measures the characteristics of the phase of the arriving wavefront and corrects for the degradations by means of one or more deformable mirrors controlled by special purpose computers.No attempt is made in this paper to give a comprehensive survey of recent numerical linear applications in optical imaging. Rather, two fairly representative applications are discussed in some detail. The following research topics in the area of adaptive optics control systems, each involving the formulation and numerical solution of difficult problems in numerical linear algebra, are described: (1) Jacobi-like eigenvalue computations for multiple bandwidth deformable mirror control methods, and (2) covariance matrix computations for performance modeling of adaptive optics systems using fast Hankel transforms.},

By maintaining a Reynolds number, Re, of 500 and an equivalence ratio, /, of 1.8, interferograms of the impinging-flame jet were obtained for various nozzle-to-plate-distances. Temperature fields of the flame were then determined using the inverse Abel transformation from the obtained interferograms. Temperatures at several locations were measured experimentally with a T-type thermocouple: they were used as a reference to help in the determination as well as the validation. In the present study, a non-contact method has been successfully developed to measure the temperature fields of a circular impinging gas-fired flame jet. {\'O} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The wave aberrations in human eyes across 5.2 mm pupil for two subjects are first measured with Hartmann-Shack wave-front sensor and then are successfully corrected with the SVAG1 TFT-LCD. The peak-to-valley wave-front errors of the eyes are reduced by a factor of approximate three and close to the Rayleigh quarter-wave criterion by the correction. It is shown with the modulation transfer function (MTF) analysis that the ultimate resolution of the eyes increases respectively from 17 c/deg to 38 c/deg and from 14 c/deg to 36 c/deg for two subjects, which is even higher than the optimum resolution of the normal eyes (approximate 30 c/deg) and implies a supernormal vision is achieved. Therefore the SVAG1 TFT-LCD is a promising device in the closed-loop adaptive optics system to perform wave-front compensation to achieve supernormal vision and high-resolution retinal imaging.},

  Abstract                 = {An advanced 3D self-assembling technique of surface micromachined polysilicon structures is presented here aiming at the realization of dedicated large stroke actuators for optical applications. The 3D polysilicon microparts are self-assembled by beam buckling induced by integrated scratch drive actuator (SDA). With this technique, 380 [mu]m x 250 [mu]m microplates were lifted upward at 90 [mu]m above substrate plane. Once the assembling has been performed, the 3D shapes are permanently kept by an integrated mechanical lock. Subsequent to the 3D assembling, microplates were successfully actuated by biasing underneath buried electrodes. Controlled motion up to +/-15[deg] rotation was measured and analyzed by means of both analytical and numerical models. Long-term actuations were carried out without any observable changes even for 0.5 [mu]m thin polysilicon structures. Therefore, 3D large stroke actuator has been implemented in a micro-opto-electromechanical system (MOEMS): a continuous membrane for adaptive optics application. This original device demonstrates, both positive and negative deflection with individual pixel displacement of +/-10 [mu]m, which is one order of magnitude larger than usual approaches. The deformable mirror is constituted by a thin-film bulk-micromachined membrane that covers large stroke actuators composed of an array of self-assembling/self-locking 3D polysilicon electrostatic microplates.},

The HITRAN program is also involved in the Ozone Monitoring Experiment (OMI). The data requirements of these programs in terms of spectroscopy are varied with respect to constituents being observed, required remote-sensing parameters, and spectral coverage. A general requisite is for additional spectral parameters and improvements to existing molecular bands sufficient for the simulation of the observations leading to retrieval of the atmospheric state. In addition, cross-section data for heavier molecular species must be expanded and made amenable to modeling in remote sensing. The effort in the project also includes developing software and distribution to make access, manipulation, and use of HITRAN functional to the EOS program.},

The line-by-line portion of the database contains spectroscopic parameters for 39 molecules including many of their isotopologues. The format of the section of the database on individual line parameters of HITRAN has undergone the most extensive enhancement in almost two decades. It now lists the Einstein A-coefficients, statistical weights of the upper and lower levels of the transitions, a better system for the representation of quantum identifications, and enhanced referencing and uncertainty codes. In addition, there is a provision for making corrections to the broadening of line transitions due to line mixing.},

This paper outlines the ways in which the conventional trade-offs of sensitivity against imager and scene parameters are modified when electron storage capacity and non-uniformity are taken into account. In the presence of these limitations, the emphasis is frequently on optimizing image contrast rather than signal level or even photon-limited signal/noise ratio (SNR), resulting in more severe degradations due to equipment limitations such as transmission of hot windows or cold-shield inefficiency, and in reduced spectral bandwidths for optimum sensitivity. The dependence of sensitivity on cut-off wavelength is illustrated for a range of imager parameters, and the benefits of cooled or pseudo-cooled spectral filters are discussed. Optimum cut-off wavelength, particularly in the 3 - 5 micrometers (MWIR) band is found to depend strongly on system parameters. Comparisons are made between scanning and staring systems. In the 8 - 12 micrometers (LWIR) band scanning systems can compete well with staring arrays for equivalent frame rates, but improvements in multiplexer technology to give higher storage capacity or faster read-out will increasingly favor staring systems for all bands.},

This dependence is related to aerosol forward scatter as well as particulate absorption effects, shown to be primary contributors to blur in thermal imaging through the atmosphere. One of the primary models for target acquisition is the Institute for Defence Analysis variant of the Night Vision Laboratory (IDA/NVL) target acquisition model; in this paper, this model is revised to include atmospheric MTF spatial frequency dependence. It is shown how the target acquisition probabilities and, conversly, the range at which targets can be detected are changed by the inclusion of atmospheric effects. Under weak turbulence conditions target acquisition probabilities are better than predicted by the IDA/NVL model at shorter ranges. For very strong turbulence, as at midday on hot days, target acquisition probabilities decrease. Effects of real-time image restoration are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the fabrication technology of two different implementations of a spatial light modulator. Both implementations are based on continuous reflective membranes that are deformed electrostatically by potentials applied on an underlying electrode structure. By using a continuous membrane we achieve a 100% optical fill factor. Additionally, the membrane can be coated with any metal, enabling it to use a uniform technology to fabricate devices able to handle a high optical load over a wide spectral range. The first implementation is based on a continuous thin nitride membrane that rests on a support grid structure, which subdivides the membrane into individually controllable pixels. The second implementation uses viscoelastic layers as a carrier material for the reflective membrane, making the device more robust, enabling a high resolution, but a slower speed of response. Experiments with fabricated devices have shown sufficient deflection at low control voltages, making the use of integrated electronics possible. Applications for these devices include projection displays, optical information processing systems, optical lithography, etc.},

For these reasons, accurate modeling of new systems becomes a requirement. This document represents the current status of a first-principles physics-based synthetic image generation model, DIRSIG, capable of producing the radiance field reaching the front-end of an airborne or terrestrial imaging system. This model accounts for the major material interaction effect for objects in the scene in both the reflective and emissive portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, their thermodynamic behavior in a natural environment, and the propagation of energy through the atmosphere. The model is demonstrated to produce viable imagery in both the qualitative and quantitative sense. In the thermal infrared portion of the spectrum, results are demonstrated in which temperatures are shown to be modeled within truth by 5degC in the longwave-infrared and 6degC in the midwave-infrared regions. Many of the phenomena observed in infrared imagery are also demonstrated including background radiance effects and thermal shadows (signatures). In developing a model to work in these two thermal infrared passbands, the model naturally had the capabilities to work in the reflective regions. Example imagery from the reflective portion of the spectra is presented illustrating the qualitative fidelity of the model in this region, however, no quantitative analysis was conducted at this time.},

These merit functions are the MRS, or minimum resolvable signal, and I//r, the background reference current. Both can be measured. This methodology differs from other TV system performance models in that it does not require detailed knowledge of the camera design characteristics, nor does it require extensive measurement of merit functions. The described methodology removes the need to rely heavily on incomplete theoretical models and replaces them with a largely empirical method more likely to yield reliable results. The simplified approach allows many camera designs to be optimized for application requirements and evaluated without an extensive modeling effort.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys work of the last several years at Lincoln Laboratory in analysis and computer modeling of adaptive optics hardware, especially in the context of compensation for thermal blooming. We discuss an analytical theory of thermal blooming phase-compensation instability (PCI) incorporating the actuator geometry of real deformable mirrors and wavefront sensors; we also discuss novel algorithms for computer simulation of adaptive optics hardware. Our analytical formalism makes possible a quantitative analysis of the effects of the adaptive-optics control system on PCI, and also leads to a universality theorem for PCI growth rates under certain control-system assumptions. It also leads to the recognition that wind has a stronger effect on PCI growth rates than previously thought. Simulation algorithms discussed here include models of a Hartmann wavefront sensor, multidither adaptive optics, and a null-seeking servo. Analysis and algorithms are illustrated with output from MOLLY, a computer simulation of time-dependent adaptively-compensated laser propagation through turbulence and thermal blooming, optimized for the Cray-2 supercomputer. Of particular note is a comparison between MOLLY output and data from a laboratory study of phase-compensation instability.},

The effects of aberrations on visual performance are reviewed, and the theoretical limit of visual performance is predicted to understand the ultimate endpoint of these new technologies. A schematic eye model that incorporates diffraction, chromatic aberration, photopic response, the Stiles-Crawford effect, and pupil size is ray-traced to determine its limiting optical properties. These properties are compared to the detection requirements of the retina and brain to determine the theoretical limit of foveal vision. The theoretical limits on foveal vision are found to be between 20/12 and 20/5, depending on pupil diameter. It is concluded that emerging refractive surgery technologies may provide substantial increases in visual performance.},

  Abstract                 = {In a Shack-Hartmann sensor the wavefront to be measured is sampled by a microlens array. The beams are directed to a spot in the focal plane. The displacement of the spots is a measure for the local gradient of the wavefront over one microlens. In the adaptive Shack-Hartmann sensor the static microlens array of the conventional sensor is replaced by a dynamic liquid crystal display (LCD). The LCD is used to display an array of Fresnel microlenses. Thereby, the Fresnel microlenses can be adapted to the wavefront and the design parameters like focal length, aperture size, position and number of lenses can be changed very quickly. We present an investigation about the wavefront reconstruction with the adaptive Shack-Hartmann sensor. Because of the large pixelsize of the LCD in comparison to static manufactured holograms the microlens diameter of the adaptive Shack-Hartmann sensor is larger than in a conventional sensor. This requires considerations in the reconstruction algorithm to minimize reconstruction errors. We compare Zernike and B-Spline wavefront reconstruction on the basis of fit accuracy, reconstruction time and the effect of missing measurement data and noise. We come to the conclusion that Zernike reconstruction is better for fitting simple wavefronts while B-Spline reconstruction is the better choice for more complex wavefronts.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time restoration of a blurred image using an all-optical adaptive-optics system with a liquid-crystal (LC) device is described. This system is based on a feedback interferometer, where the two-dimensional output fringe intensity from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with large radial shear is optically fed back to an optically addressed phase-only LC spatial light modulator (SLM). In operation the phase of the reflection-type modulator approximates to half of the conjugate of the input aberrated wave front without a separate aberration-free reference wave. We applied this system to a problem of imaging through a phase-distorting medium and observed that an image blurred by the phase disturbance was restored immediately after the feedback loop was closed. In this case the response time and the resolution of the SLM were about 60 ms and 40 line pairs/mm, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Models of target acquisition by human observers are probabilistic. Two reason for the indeterminate nature of the models are (1) the observer ensemble includes individuals with varying levels of competence in target acquisition, and (2) the target acquisition process is itself (at least in part) a random process. Each of the two commonly used combat simulations, CASTFOREM and JANUS, assumes that (a different) one of these completely accounts for the indeterminacy, and ignores the other. While the distinction is irrelevant for the simple one-on-one case, it has recently been shown that the choice can affect the outcomes of more realistic many-on-many engagements. We propose a model in which target detection probability is a function of both a target statistic and an observer statistic. Our analysis of recently compiled observer test data validates the model and provides it with the correct quantitative balance between variations among observers and the inherently stochastic component of target acquisition.},

The new model, known as FASCODE for the Environment, or "FASE," is an LBL atmospheric radiation code, which is grounded in the original USAF FASCODE (Fast Atmospheric Signature Code) line shape decomposition algorithm and now envelops both agencies' important upgrades. ARM's LBLRTM (LBL Radiative Transfer Model, authored by S. A. Clough and P. D. Brown of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. [AER]) improved the FASCODE algorithm by specifically addressing scientific and coding issues of particular concern to the climate community including the following: lineshape and radiance algorithms, H2 O and CO continua, code vectorization and array 2 parameterization, and input/output modes. These features have been recombined with the FASCODE non-LTE and laser options, plus shared common elements from MODTRAN (Moderate Resolution Transmittance Model, a 2 cm-1 band model) evolution. These latter options include new solar irradiance (for direct transmittance and surface reflectance), upgraded UV cross sections, and improved cloud and aerosol descriptions. This paper gives an overview of recent model validations and the implementation of new features.},

  Abstract                 = {{What assumptions and methods allow us to turn observations into causal knowledge, and how can even incomplete causal knowledge be used in planning and prediction to influence and control our environment? In this book Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks, with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social, behavioral, and physical sciences. The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences, they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence, explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability, formulate a theory of manipulation, and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models, including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables. The
authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation, Simpson's paradox, errors in regression models, retrospective versus prospective sampling, and variable selection. The second edition contains a new introduction and an extensive survey of advances and applications that have appeared since the first edition was published in 1993.}},

We concentrate on those aspects of the spectroscopy that are especially relevant for temperature and water vapor retrievals. The AIRS-RTA is a hybrid model in that it parameterizes most gases on a fixed grid of pressures, while the water optical depths are parameterized on a fixed grid of water amounts. Water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide, and methane profiles can be varied, in addition to the column abundance of carbon dioxide.

Firstly, a detection and tracking algorithm test-bed developed by DSTO and running on a PC under Windows NT is being used to assess candidate algorithms for unresolved and minimally resolved target detection. The structure of this test-bed is described and examples are given of its user interfaces and outputs. Secondly, a development by Australian industry under a Defence-funded contract, of a reconfigurable generic track processor (GTP) is outlined. The GTP will include reconfigurable image processing stages and target tracking algorithms. It will be used to demonstrate to the Australian Defence Force automatic detection and tracking capabilities, and to serve as a hardware base for real time algorithm refinement.},

  abstract  = {Optical countermeasures have been used for several millennia to provide a defensive capability. The fundamental
approach is to use an intense optical source to dazzle a sensor or distract an operator or target tracking system causing a
weapon to missile its intended target. The development of the laser has provided a stimulus for a number of soft-kill
weapon systems used to enhance platform survivability and anti-air missile applications; in this case the laser may cause
dazzle, or if the beam is sufficiently intense it may cause damage. Laser technology is also crucial for an aspect of
directed energy weapons.
The various aspects of optical countermeasures are considered in this paper, including defeat mechanisms of active and
passive techniques. The review includes a historical perspective through to prospects for the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Current space cryocooler developments have achieved performance and capability that have made the use of active refrigeration in space missions feasible. Space flight demonstrations such as the Sandia National Laboratory Cobra Brass and Multispectral Thermal Imager missions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration SABER, Hyperion, and AIRS missions baselined and implemented active refrigeration to achieve mission goals. The NASA retrofit of the NICMOS cooling system on the Hubble Space Telescope, due to be installed during a 2001 servicing mission, will use a reverse Brayton cycle cryocooler to provide cooling for the NICMOS sensor due to a prematurely depleted cryogen dewar. These applications of cryocooler technology validate the improved mission capabilities and reliability and lifetime confidence in active refrigeration in space. Current cryogenic integration and cryocooler development programs address the negative impacts of the cryogenic system on optical space systems including: induced line of sight vibration, longevity, power consumption, mass, thermal transport, thermal storage, and thermal switching. However, the cryogenic cooling requirements for future Air Force systems may require large capacity cryogenic cooling, extremely mass and power efficient mechanical refrigerators, and significant improvements in long term on orbit cryogen storage. The technical efforts at AFRL concentrate on exploratory and advanced development programs that focus on the development of technology from concept and breadboard engineering models to protoflight models that are geared to experimental characterization and technology transition for flight demonstrations and, potentially, operational programs. This paper will focus on mid term and out year cooling requirements for the Air Force Space Based Infrared System Low, Space Based Laser, Advanced Space Based Infrared System, and other Department of Defense space missions. In addition, current and planned Air Force programs to address these requirements will be outlined.},

  abstract  = {Atmospheric correction of satellite measurements is a major step in the retrieval of surface reflective properties. It involves removing the effect of gaseous absorption as well as correcting for the effect of an atmospheric molecular and particulate scattering. In the past few years, there has been significant advancement in our knowledge of the absorbing properties of various atmospheric radiatively active gases. In particular, Giver et al. (2000) reported important updates to the parameters of line and continuum absorption by water vapor. These and other updates have been incorporated into HIRTRAN spectroscopic database and implemented in Moderate-Resolution Atmospheric Radiance and Transmittance Model-4 (MODTRAN-4) radiative transfer model (Berk et al. 2001). We used the latest version of MODTRAN-4 combined with updated high-resolution transmission (HITRAN) 2001 database (Rothman et. al. 2001) to estimate the impact of these improvements on atmospheric correction of the signal in solar domain for various satellite sensors. The objectives of our study are to (1) develop fast, but accurate semi-analytical atmospheric correction scheme suitable for implementation in operational data processing of satellite narrowband observations, (2) estimate the impact of improved molecular spectroscopy on a atmospheric correction and surface reflectance retrievals, and (3) derive the sensor specific model parameters for narrowband satellite sensors, such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR/2 and AVHRR/3), aboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecrafts, VEGETATION (VGT) sensor aboard SPOT, geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES) imager, Landsat thematic mapper (TM), and enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and selected moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels using comprehensive radiative transfer modeling employing MODTRAN-4.},

In optics, these functions are used to determine the aberrated wavefront. By using the finite element method, we give a model of the adaptive mirror corresponding to the COME-ON project (developed by ONERA, GCE, ESO and Observatoire de Meudon). On a reduced model, we develop a quasi-static control law to determine the optimal voltage inputs, to compensate the atmospheric phase shift.},

A linear voltage is applied to the bimorph PZT optics by probing the control electrodes from a two-channel controllable power supplier. In doing so, the optics surface can achieve a desired third-order-polynomial surface. Reducing hysteresis and creep in bimorph PZT X-ray optics is the only feasible way by inserting an appropriate capacitor in series with bimorph PZT optics to significantly reduce both effects.},

  abstract  = {The Atmospheric Photophysics Group has been active in the research related to atmospheric water vapor, which is one of the most important agents in the Earth's radiation balance [Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997]. These activities include the development of algorithms for the detection of atmospheric water vapor using the satellite-borne sensor GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) [Maurellis et al., 2000]. The retrieval of water vapor is based on observations of scattered sunlight in the visible and near infrared part of the electro-magnetic spectrum. Spectral sampling techniques were developed for the treatment of the complex absorption spectra of water vapor [Lang et al., 2002]. New water vapor absorption data were obtained from Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy measurements [Naus et al., 2001] (at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). The retrieval of water vapor depends crucially on the detailed and accurate knowledge of the water vapor absorption as a function of the wavelength. The accurate characterization of this absorption spectrum is challenging from both a theoretical as well as from an experimental point of view [Bernath, 2002]. That is why the first part of this thesis is dedicated to the evaluation of spectroscopic data of water vapor. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to irregular mineral dust aerosol. A significant fraction of the atmospheric aerosol load is mineral dust aerosol [D'Almeida et al., 1991]. Mineral aerosol has a significant impact on the Earth's radiation balance and on the dynamics and the properties of clouds [Tegen et al., 1996; Haywood and Boucher, 2000]. Aerosols are monitored using observations of scattered and transmitted sunlight from ground-based and satellite-borne sensors [Holben et al., 1998; Kaufman et al., 2002]. For the retrieval of aerosol parameters such as the amount, the type, and the size distribution from these observations an accurate knowledge of the light scattering properties is required. The light scattering properties of aerosols depend amongst others on the particle shape. The numerical simulations of light scattering by irregularly-shaped particles is very difficult. That is why shape approximations are used for aerosol retrievals and for radiative transfer simulations in planetary atmosphere containing irregularly-shaped mineral aerosol [cf. Mishchenko et al., 1995, 1996]. In this thesis we make the link between measurements and simulations of the light scattering properties of irregular mineral aerosol.},

Accurate knowledge of the absorption spectroscopy is important for the retrieval as well as for assessing radiative forcing. Spectral databases for this wavelength region lack experimental validation by atmospheric observations. By means of a line-by-line radiative transfer model we simulate the direct solar radiation reaching the ground using different spectral databases. We compare simulated spectra with high resolution measurements made using a ground based Fourier transform spectrometer. Instrument effects are considered and residuals are assigned to line intensity errors as far as possible. A quality estimate of four different databases is provided and the consequences for satellite based instrumentations are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The Pyramid Wave-Front Sensor (PWS) [J. Mod. Opt., 43 (1996) 289] was first presented as a novel slope sensor which is similar to the well-known Shack-Hartmann Sensor (SHS), with the advantage of a better sensitivity in closed loop operation [Astron. Astrophys. 350 (1999) L23]. An ideal SHS measures the first derivative of an incident wave-front thus permitting the main properties of error propagation to be determined. In this paper, an easy-to-handle relationship between the PWS measurements and the wave-front phase is derived and the results are compared to an existing analytical model for the SHS [Proc. SPIE 3353 (1998) 1038]. This new model shows that the PWS inherits some properties of both slope and direct phase sensors. Comparison of results confirms the gain in limiting magnitude over the SHS and predicts a significantly lower sensitivity to aliasing and thus more contrast in corrected images.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the results of a comparative study on the target acquisition performance of an eye-slaved helmet display system and unaided human vision. A teleoperated visual sensor system records the visual information that the human visual system can sense at a remote site, transmits the information to a remote operator, and reconstructs the information in real time on an eye-slaved helmet display system. The display system design is based on the following: The physiology of the eye shows that the density of cone cells responsible for scotopic (day) vision reduces drastically with off-boresight angle, as well as the corresponding resolution. The human visual system can be adequately stimulated over a 60 degree field of view with only two video channels, a wide field of view for peripheral vision and a narrow field of view for foveal vision. The widefield and narrow-field information can be displayed into separate eyes with the human brain doing the integration between the two pictures. This paper provides experimental proof of this hypothesis. The narrow field display can be made to track the human eyeball during target acquisition tasks, without unduly distracting natural vision. During target search tasks the human eye movement exhibits rapid saccadic movements (100-150ms) after which it fixates on some feature on the picture for 200-300 ms). During and for a small time after the saccadic movement, the neural activity of the eye is inhibited. This inhabitation period can be used by a machine to track the eyeball and to slave the picture to the eyeball through a set of mirrors, without injecting conflicting information to the human visual system during the saccade. An eye-slaved helmet display system was build with a simulated monochrome target scenario. The final experiment evaluates the target acquisition performance of a number of subjects with both the eye-slaved helmet display system and direct vision on the same pre-recorded scenario. The experimental design used two different target contrasts, four target ranges and four positions. Two control experiments were also done, one in which the same scenario was printed on a viewing board and a set of target acquisition experiments done with unaided vision, and the other where a joystick controlled sight was simulated with a terminal display system. The eye slaved display results is better than the terminal display results, and not far off from the direct vision test results. It was found that test subjects had to be free of strabismus and monoscopic fixation, for the eye-slaved helmet display system to work. We conclude that an eye-slaved display system design is the key technology for remote controlled sighting systems with similar capabilities to unaided human vision.},

  Abstract                 = {The Johnson criteria have been shown to be fundamentally flawed due to their insensitivity to effects below the limiting frequency. This flaw makes predictions for many modern imaging systems inaccurate. A new target acquisition metric, the targeting task performance (TTP) metric, has been developed that provides better accuracy than the Johnson criteria. Further, unlike the Johnson criteria, the TTP metric can be applied directly to sampled imagers and to imagers that exhibit colored (spectrally weighted) noise due to frequency boost. Experimental data using both target recognition and target identification tasks show the problems with the Johnson criteria and illustrate the robust performance of the TTP metric. The simplicity of implementing a range performance model with the Johnson criteria is retained by the TTP metric while extending applicability of the model to sampled imagers and digital image enhancement. &copy; 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

A multiple baseline imagery database was obtained during a field test. The targets were personnel wearing forest camouflage uniforms. They were arrayed at two rural terrain sites. The weather condition at the first site was clear to partly cloudy and at the second site overcast with light rain. The preliminary analysis of the first site database indicated that wide baseline stereo can improve search and target acquisition, but that the baseline used was too wide for many of the closer targets at that site. The database from the second site was then analyzed through observer testing, with single line of sight and wide baseline stereo displays. The results indicate that with training, stereo vision effectively reduces false alarm detection by a factor of 2. Additionally, guidelines are obtained for optimum stereo display that can be used to improve positive target detection by 20%. &copy; 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

It depends on many factors, such as: * Whether the (gaseous) fuel flow is laminar (smooth) or turbulent * Whether the fuel and oxidixer are premixed, or simply diffuse together while burning * Whether the flame is "adiabatic", meaning that it does not lose heat. While impossible in practice, the theoretical adiabatic temperature is often quoted. * Where in a (laminar) flame the temperature is measured * For flames in air, the temperature, humidity, pressure, present gas mixture, etc. of the air * The mixture of fuel vs. oxidixer in use. For example, an acetylene/oxygene flame may be neutral (equal mix: complete combustion, white rounded cone); carburising (excess acetylene: large smoky yellow flame); or oxidising (excess oxygen: short, sharp inner cone, deeper purple hissing flame).},

  Abstract                 = {The Surveillance Test Bed (STB) is a program under development for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO). Its most salient features are (1) the integration of high fidelity backgrounds and optical signal processing models with algorithms for sensor tasking, bulk filtering, track/correlation and discrimination and (2) the integration of radar and optical estimates for track and discrimination. Backgrounds include induced environments such as nuclear events, fragments and debris, and natural environments, such as earth limb, zodiacal light, stars, sun and moon. At the highest level of fidelity, optical emulation hardware combines environmental information with threat information to produce detector samples for signal processing algorithms/hardware under test. Simulation of visible sensors and radars model measurement degradation due to the various environmental effects. The modeled threat is composed of multiple object classes. The number of discrimination classes are further increased by inclusion of fragments, debris and stars. High fidelity measurements will be used to drive bulk filtering algorithms that seek to reject fragments and debris and, in the case of optical sensors, stars. The output of the bulk filters will be used to drive track/correlation algorithms. Track algorithm output will include sequences of measurements that have been degraded by backgrounds, closely spaced objects (CSOs), signal processing errors, bulk filtering errors and miscorrelations; these measurements will be presented as input to the discrimination algorithms. The STB will implement baseline IR track file editing and IR and radar feature extraction and classification algorithms. The baseline will also include data fusion algorithms which will allow the combination of discrimination estimates from multiple sensors, including IR and radar; alternative discrimination algorithms may be substituted for the baseline after STB completion.},

  title     = {{Flames}},
  abstract  = {A flame is often defined as the visible (light-emitting) part of a fire. Physically, it is caused by a highly exothermic reaction (for example, combustion, a self-sustaining oxidation reaction) taking place in a thin zone. A flame generally emits light, by two different mechanisms which will be described below. The color and temperature of a flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion, as, for example, when a lighter is held to a candle. The applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the wick to vaporize. In this state they can then readily react with oxygen in the air, which gives off enough heat in the subsequent exothermic reaction to vaporize yet more fuel, thus sustaining a consistent flame. The high temperature of the flame tears apart the vaporized fuel molecules, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals, and these products then react with each other and with the oxidizer involved in the reaction. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in some of the transient reaction intermediates such as CH and C2, which results in the emission of visible light as these substances release their excess energy (see spectrum below for an explanation of which specific radical species produce which specific colors). As the combustion temperature of a flame increases (if the flame contains small particles of unburnt carbon or other material), so does the average energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame.},

Varieties of LPG bought and sold include mixes that are primarily propane, mixes that are primarily butane, and the more common, mixes including both propane (60%) and butane (40%), depending on the season---in winter more propane, in summer more butane. Propylene and butylenes are usually also present in small concentration. A powerful odorant, ethanethiol, is added so that leaks can be detected easily. The international standard is EN 589. LPG is manufactured during the refining of crude oil, or extracted from oil or gas streams as they emerge from the ground.},

  Abstract                 = {The primary source of battlespace intelligence for the Army's proposed Interim Brigade Combat Team (BCT) is the Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Squadron. The fundamental role of the RSTA Squadron is to provide detailed situational understanding to the BCT Commander facilitating freedom of maneuver and the concentration of combat power at the decisive time and place. Technologically advanced systems should substantially enhance RSTA Squadron operations. Among the proposed systems in the Squadron are the Future Scout and Cavalry System (FSCS), tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAV), ground-based networked sensors (acoustic, seismic, magnetic, infrared, radio frequency), radio frequency (RF) detectors, and nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) reconnaissance systems. This paper outlines the process used to date for designing the RSTA Squadron and proposes an alternative approach: a systems engineering methodology to formulate, analyze and interpret RSTA Squadron design alternatives.},

The effect of temperature on the available water requirements of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Wodzinski and Frazier, 1960), Aerobacter aerogenes (Wodzinski and Frazier, 1961a), and Lactobacillus viridescens (Wodzinski and Frazier, 1961b), has been studied in air. In the present work we studied the effect of solute concentration, expressed as water activity or available water, on the apparent lag phase and the logarithmic phase of growth of P. fluorescens, A. aerogenes, and L. viridescens, and noted what effect, if any, different partial pressures of carbon dioxide at different temperatures have at different levels of available water.},

  abstract  = {A new set of high spectral resolution sensors to monitor the variations of cloud and atmospheric properties have been developed and are starting to be deployed either in space or on the ground. The development of improved retrieval algorithms and the analysis of these new data sets require rapid radiative transfer models that have commensurate spectral resolution. Although a number of radiative transfer models are available, user-friendly, accurate, high resolution spectral models that can be used to develop atmospheric, cloud and aerosol retrieval methodologies are missing. This paper describes SBDART-MOD, a new radiative transfer model covering from the visible to the infrared part of the spectrum that could serve as an alternative intermediary standard to the line-by-line models when repeated sensitivity and validation computations are necessary. The new model is based on the Santa Barbara discrete ordinate radiative transfer (DISORT) Atmospheric Radiative Transfer computer program, or SBDART (Ricchiazzi et al. 1998) to compute shortwave and near-infrared radiation at low spectral resolution. Despite its flexibility, SBDART is not appropriate to use with instruments that have a spectral resolution of 10 nm or better, if filter response functions are to be accounted for properly. SBDART is user-friendly and allows the user to access a set of physical models describing absorption, emission, and scattering in the earth's atmosphere. For gaseous absorption, it is based on band models from the LOWTRAN 6 computer program (Kneizys et al. 1983) and therefore has the 20 cm-1 resolution of that model. For scattering, it is based on the DISORT computer program (Stamnes et al. 1988).},

In contrast to previously reported spatial diversity detectors which use the decorrelating or minimum mean square (MMSE) detector for each receiving antenna, our algorithms employ the known signature waveform to estimate the combining vector for the desired user. Therefore, we only need to resolve the decorrelating detector or MMSE detector once by combining the array outputs with estimated combining vector. The new algorithm can provide the same performance improvement as that offered by the conventional spatial diversity multiuser detectors with significant savings on computational complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {A simplified analytical model for the analysis of the performances of an adaptive optics system is described for application to direct detection free-space optical communication in the atmosphere. The transfer function of the adaptive optics control loop is calculated in the Zernike and Fourier domains for temporal and spatial dependence, respectively, and is used to determine the power spectrum of the corrected wavefront. To illustrate the model, an adaptive optics system is studied for the downlink channel of the free-space optical link operated by the European Space Agency between the ARTEMIS satellite and the Optical Ground Station in Tenerife Island, Spain.},

  Abstract                 = {This study considered the dynamic characteristics of adaptive optical systems with constant time delays and 'fast-acting' adaptive systems which use information on the rate of change of the phase. It was found that the relative effectiveness of the 'fast-acting' system improved with an increase in the intensity of the turbulence. A new approach was proposed for adaptive control of an optical system which is based on predicting successive states. The effectiveness of making mode corrections in predictive systems was evaluated. 'Dichromatic' adaptive systems were considered in which the feedback was at a different wavelength. The effectiveness of frequency scaling with such systems was indicated, and the technique of phase conjugation of the reference wave in dichromatic adaptive systems was analyzed. Experiments revealed the properties for the minimization of thermal distortions of intense coherent optical beams of radiation.},

  abstract = {In many applications, such as development and testing of image processing algorithms, it is often necessary to simulate images containing realistic noise from solid-state photosensors. A high-level model of CCD and CMOS photosensors based on a literature review is formulated in this paper. The model includes photo-response non-uniformity, photon shot noise, dark current Fixed Pattern Noise, dark current shot noise, offset Fixed Pattern Noise, source follower noise, sense node reset noise, and quantisation noise. The model also includes voltage-to-voltage, voltage-to-electrons, and analogue-to-digital converter non-linearities. The formulated model can be used to create synthetic images for testing and validation of image processing algorithms in the presence of realistic images noise. An example of the simulated CMOS photosensor and a comparison with a custom-made CMOS hardware sensor is presented. Procedures for characterisation from both light and dark noises are described. Experimental results that confirm the validity of the numerical model are provided. The paper addresses the issue of the lack of comprehensive high-level photosensor models that enable engineers to simulate realistic effects of noise on the images obtained from solid-state photosensors.},

We concentrate on those aspects of the spectroscopy that are especially relevant for temperature and water vapor retrievals. The AIRS-RTA is a hybrid model in that it parameterizes most gases on a fixed grid of pressures, while the water optical depths are parameterized on a fixed grid of water amounts. Water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide, and methane profiles can be varied, in addition to the column abundance of carbon dioxide.

	necessary to understand and assess the performance of the great proliferation
	of electro-optical systems, including image intensifiers, video cameras,
	and thermal imagers. Assuming a senior undergraduate level of optics
	knowledge, the book is suitable for graduate courses in optics, electro-optics,

	systems designers who require a means of assessing and specifying
	the performance of imaging systems. It is also of interest to physicists
	and engineers working in all areas of imaging.

	analysis, no matter how insightful, isn't going to stay relevant
	forever. The second edition of Interferogram Analysis for Optical
	Testing is designed to meet the needs of all those involved or wanting
	to become involved in this area of advanced optical engineering.
	For those new to the science, it provides the necessary fundamentals,
	including basic computational methods for studying fringe patterns.
	For those with deeper experience, it fills in the gaps and adds the
	information necessary to complete and update one's education. Written
	by the most experienced researchers in optical testing, this text
	discusses classical and innovative fringe analysis, principles of
	Fourier theory, digital image filtering, phase detection algorithms,
	and aspheric wavelength testing. It also explains how to assess wavefront
	deformation by calculating slope and local average curvature.},

                 of data acquisition and analysis using the power of the
                 Python language. At the heart of this book lies the
                 coverage of pandas, an open source, BSD-licensed
                 library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data
                 structures and data analysis tools for the Python
                 programming language. Author Fabio Nelli expertly shows
                 the strength of the Python programming language when
                 applied to processing, managing and retrieving
                 information. Inside, you will see how intuitive and
                 flexible it is to discover and communicate meaningful
                 patterns of data using Python scripts, reporting
                 systems, and data export. This book examines how to go
                 about obtaining, processing, storing, managing and
                 analyzing data using the Python programming language.
                 You will use Python and other open source tools to
                 wrangle data and tease out interesting and important
                 trends in that data that will allow you to predict
                 future patterns. Whether you are dealing with sales
                 data, investment data (stocks, bonds, etc.), medical
                 data, web page usage, or any other type of data set,
                 Python can be used to interpret, analyze, and glean
                 information from a pile of numbers and statistics. This
                 book is an invaluable reference with its examples of
                 storing and accessing data in a database; it walks you
                 through the process of report generation; it provides
                 three real world case studies or examples that you can
                 take with you for your everyday analysis needs.},

                 you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that
                 do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand
                 no prior programming experience required. Once you've
                 mastered the basics of programming, you'll create
                 Python programs that effortlessly perform useful and
                 impressive feats of automation to: Search for text in a
                 file or across multiple files; Create, update, move,
                 and rename files and folders; Search the Web and
                 download online content; Update and format data in
                 Excel spreadsheets of any size; Split, merge,
                 watermark, and encrypt PDFs; Send reminder emails and
                 text notifications; Fill out online forms. Step-by-step
                 instructions walk you through each program, and
                 practice projects at the end of each chapter challenge
                 you to improve those programs and use your newfound
                 skills to automate similar tasks.},

  abstract  = {Python is a free, open source, easy-to-use software
                 tool that offers a significant alternative to
                 proprietary packages such as MATLAB and Mathematica.
                 This book covers everything the working scientist needs
                 to know to start using Python effectively. The author
                 explains scientific Python from scratch, showing how
                 easy it is to implement and test non-trivial
                 mathematical algorithms and guiding the reader through
                 the many freely available add-on modules. A range of
                 examples, relevant to many different fields, illustrate
                 the program's capabilities. In particular, readers are
                 shown how to use pre-existing legacy code (usually in
                 Fortran77) within the Python environment, thus avoiding
                 the need to master the original code. Instead of
                 exercises the book contains useful snippets of tested
                 code which the reader can adapt to handle problems in
                 their own field, allowing students and researchers with
                 little computer expertise to get up and running as soon
                 as possible.},

                 take your skills to the next stage? Even if you know
                 enough to be productive, there are a number of features
                 that can take you to the next level in Python. Pro
                 Python, Second Edition explores concepts and features
                 normally left to experimentation, allowing you to be
                 even more productive and creative. In addition to pure
                 code concerns, Pro Python develops your programming
                 techniques and approaches, which will help make you a
                 better Python programmer. This book will improve not
                 only your code but also your understanding and
                 interaction with the many established Python
                 communities. This book takes your Python knowledge and
                 coding skills to the next level. It shows you how to
                 write clean, innovative code that will be respected by
                 your peers. With this book, make your code do more with
                 introspection and meta-programming. And learn and later
                 use the nuts and bolts of an application, tier-by-tier
                 as a complex case study along the way. For more

ground based target and own-missile tracking, data up-link, and on-board
missile measurement and track fusion is the natural choice for air-defence. An
IMM is used to process radar measurements, combining the estimates from
filters with different target dynamics. The remote missile state observer
combines up-linked target tracks and missile plots with IMU and seeker data to
provide optimal guidance information.

The performance of traditional PN and CLOS missile guidance is the basis
against which on-line trajectory optimisation is judged. Enhanced guidance
laws are presented that demand more from the state observers, stressing the
importance of time-to-go and transport delays in strap-down systems
employing staring array technology. Algorithms for solving the guidance twopoint
boundary value problems created from the missile state observer output
using gradient projection in function space are presented.

we use two different spectral bands in the middle and near IR regions

spectral distribution characteristics of the target and the flare. The proposed
algorithm computes the MNR of the band signals, detects the
MNR of the flare (MNRF) from the MNR histogram, and then cancels the
flare signal from the middle band signal using the MNRF. We simulate
the MNRF detection and the target signal extraction for the performance
evaluation. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm
can cancel efficiently the effect of IR countermeasures under various
conditions. Particularly, unlike conventional algorithms, the proposed algorithm
can extract very well the target signal even when the target and
flare signals are mixed in time domain. In addition, it is applicable to any
ever-changing environment},

  abstract  = {It is the aim of this presentation to discuss the sensitivity of certain pyrotechnic compositions applied in countermeasure stores based on data from the literature. It is recommended to investigate the IM properties of in-service pyrotechnic ammunition. Introduction Today pyrotechnic ammunition is of paramount importance when it comes to the protection of the warfighter against sophisticated threats. IRCM-flares protect airplanes, helicopters and naval vessels [1-2]. Obscurants mainly based on red phosphorus protect both marine and land targets [3]. Finally signaling and illumination ammunition is necessary for illumination of the battlefield and perimeter protection. Due to the catastrophic accidents in the 1960s involving explosives on the aircraft carriers USS Oriskany and USS Forrestal the US Navy started the development of explosives that would be less vulnerable to unplanned stimuli such as fuel fires and bullet impact than conventional explosives in use at that time. The result is now a large array of insensitive and also extremely insensitive detonating substances (EIDS) which in recent times are applied in a constantly increasing number of articles. Based on the US Navy standard MIL-STD-2105A the STANAG 4439 Ed. 2 and AOP 39 Ed 2 have been developed which describe in detail the test methods to evaluate insensitive munitions [4]. The public perception of insensitive munitions focuses on high explosives and propellants nearly exclusively. However the importance of pyrotechnic countermeasure ammunition as part of the soft-kill concept in protecting the troops requires consideration of the vulnerability of pyrotechnic ammunition. Contrary to high explosives and propellants which have been developed to detonate, to deflagrate and to burn fiercely pyrotechnic compositions most often are designed to burn in slow fashion. It is perhaps hence that catastrophic reactions of pyrotechnic ammunition are not expected in general upon subjection of pyrotechnic ammunition to unplanned stimuli such as fast heating or bullet impact. Within the context of this presentation catastrophic reactions are considered Type I --- IV reactions according to STANAG 4439 Ed. 2, that are detonation, partial detonation, explosion and deflagration.},

sensitivities of IR sensors, irradiances from external sources are investigated here, namely
sunshine, skyshine, and earthshine. Their role in determining the IR contrast in the 1.9---2.9,
3---5, and 8---12 um bands is studied. Estimation of earthshine is emphasized because of its
tactical significance in low altitude missions and IR imaging studies. A comparison of IR
radiance from aircraft's rear fuselage due to internal and external sources shows different roles
in the 3---5 and 8---12 um bands. The important roles of earthshine and temperature-based
radiance of aircraft surfaces are identified in the 8---12 um band.},

suppressor originated from engine exhaust nozzle and the external flow around helicopter airframe
originated from rotor downwash were computed in a coupled mode to determine the temperature

distributions, a forwardebackward ray-tracing method was used to calculate the infrared radiation intensity

strong downwards deflection to the rear-fuselage, as well as to the rotor rotational direction under the
action of rotor downwash. The rotor downwash has a complicated influence on the infrared radiation
distribution of helicopter. It is benefit for reducing the infrared radiation intensity when the exhaust is
ejected in oblique-turned or lateral-turned mode. While for the up-turned exhaust mode, the exhaust
plume could heating the helicopter rear-fuselage and the infrared radiation intensity may be enhanced
under the action of downwash.},

in three situations: firstly, by varying the aspect angle between
the camera's field of view and the turbine's longitudinal axis,
while maintaining a fixed engine velocity of rotation; secondly
by varying this velocity for fixed aspect angle and, finally, for a
small spectroradiometer field of view when observing three

  abstract  = {infrared (IR) seekers have exploited techniques to passively acquire and intercept airborne targets, by detecting their IR energy. The basic principle of IR detection is the
discrimination of target's IR radiance in the detector's wavelength band with the background IR radiance (atmospheric emission/solar radiation). In an aircraft, the internal sources include plume and surface emissions; and power-plant is the major and reliable source. The aircraft rear fuselage skin of a typical military aircraft is heated by the flow of hot combustion products in the embedded engine. The solid angle subtended by the rear fuselage skin is an order of magnitude larger than that of the tailpipe. Therefore, its contribution is significant especially in the 8--12~\myum{}  band; in which, IR-detection is possible also due to external sources, e.g., earthshine and skyshine reflection.  Unlike surfaces of solids, gases emit and absorb radiation only at discrete wavelengths associated
with specific rotational and vibrational frequencies. These frequencies depend on the particular type of molecule, temperature, pressure, and molecular concentration of radiation participating specie. The atmosphere limits the use of the IR spectrum to specific bands called as atmospheric windows; and has a crucial role, which includes that of transmission and background radiance.   Due to significant advancements in the performance of IR-detectors, modern missiles are generally constrained by their burnout range rather than their lock-on range.},

The IR signature due to the aircraft plume is examined in a holistic manner. A comprehensive methodology of computing IR signatures and its affect on aircraft lock-on range is elaborated. Commercial CFD software has been used to predict the plume thermo-physical properties and subsequently an in-house developed code was used for evaluating the IR radiation emitted by the plume. The LOWTRAN code has been used for modeling the atmospheric IR characteristics. The results obtained from these models are in reasonable agreement with some available experimental data. The analysis carried out in this paper succinctly brings out the intricacy of the radiation emitted by various gaseous species in the plume and the role of atmospheric IR transmissivity in dictating the plume IR signature as perceived by an IR guided SAM.},

after adjusting the gray levels of the arbitrary IR target signatures based on their radiances for the wavelength
band of the transformed IR background, these IR target and background signatures can be synthesized
as one image for a specific wavelength band. The experimental results show that the modeled IR
target images, such as a modeled helicopter and F16, can be synthesized on the IR background images

indicate that the infrared radiation of the plume is determined by the energy characteristics of the

are established. By including the chemical reaction source term and the radiation source term into
the energy equation, the plume field and the radiative transfer are solved in a coupled way. The calculated
results are consistent with the experimental data, so the reliability of the models is confirmed.
The temperature distribution and the extent of the afterburning of the plume are distinct
for the propellants of different energy characteristics, therefore the plume radiation varies for different
propellants. The temperature of the fluid cell in the plume will increase or decrease to some
extent by the influence of the radiation term.},

domain. Modulated RF signals are digitally sampled and then demodulated in real time
using signal processing techniques and a digital signal processor (DSP). A digital board
capable of these tasks is often termed a "digital radio." This paper results from the
availability of a digital radio board. The flexibility of DSP software allows a realization of
different demodulation schemes. The purpose of this paper was to test this new
technology by implementing an FM demodulator using the digital radio. A mathematical
algorithm was developed and translated into DSP software to implement the "digital FM
demodulator." The testing of the digital FM demodulator provided a performance analysis
of the developed algorithm. This paper addresses the detailed background, development,
and testing of a digital FM demodulator as implemented on a digital radio board.},

  abstract    = {Analog modulations are more and more replaced by digital ones. To keep the compatibility the
new device should be able to perform the analog modulation. A interesting solution is to solve
this with digital signal processing. In an earlier semester project, four FM demodulation algorithms
were developed and tested on their suitability. Two of them (mixed and PLL demodulator)
are are implemented on the DSP (TMS320C6711DSK).
Because both algorithms demand the same pre and after signal preparation, the demodulation
is split into sub projects to reach a high compatibility between the algorithms. First they are realized
in floating-point. That allows to concentrate on the algorithms themeselves without any
effects of a fixed-point implementation. After that, the algorithms are translated step by step from
floating-point to fixed-point. Afterwards the algorithms are optimized in time and signal quality.
As in the earlier work, the algorithms are tested out with measuring the SINAD and the signal
noise ratio of the demodulated signal. Furthermore the needed computing time of the implementations
is measured. The two algorithms are compared each other. The mixed demodulator shows
a better performance than the PLL.
The Chapters Theory 3 and Simulation 4 were not developed in this project, but in the earlier
semester project. Nevertheless they are included to get the whole context of developed digital FM
demodulation in a single document.},

modulation(AM), phase modulation(PM), and frequency modulation(FM). In this
research, we concentrated on phase locked FM demodulators. Our main two parts are
the PLL block and the Optimum Time Varying Filter block. We started our work by
building up three basic blocks of the PLL; the PFD, the Loop Filter and the VCO. By
carefully studying the structure and the operation of these blocks, we were able to
make good choices regarding the types of each block and their parameters. As a result,
we got the desired results in our PLL simulations. After that, in order to improve the
quality of the FM signal, we worked on the Optimum Time Varying Filter which is the
main research part in the overall thesis. We studied the relationship of the optimum
filter (or matched filter), the optimum time-varying filter and our band pass filter. We
then derived the necessary equations to realize our synchronous filter. Based on the
theory and equation discussion, we were able to design the band pass filter. After we
put all of the blocks together to realize our FM PLL demodulator, we simulated the
whole demodulator and recovered the FM demodulated signal which showed that we
had achieved our research goal-namely, to improve the quality of the PLL FM

  abstract  = {The threat of the IR guidance missile is a direct consequence of extensive proliferation of the airborne IR
countermeasure. The aim of a countermeasure system is to inject false information into a sensor system to create
confusion. Many optical seekers have a single detector that is used to sense the position of its victim in its field of view.
A seeker has a spinning reticle in the focal plane of the optical system that collects energy from the thermal scene and
focuses it on to the detector. In this paper, the principle of the conical-scan FM reticle is analyzed. Then the effect that
different amplitude or frequency modulated mid-infrared laser pulse acts on the reticle system is simulated. When the
ratio of jamming energy to target radiation (repression) gradually increases, the azimuth error and the misalignment
angle error become larger. The results show that simply increasing the intensity of the jamming light achieves little, but it
increases the received signal strength of the FM reticle system ,so that the target will be more easily exposed. A slow
variation of amplitude will warp the azimuth information received by the seeker, but the target can't be completely out of
the missile tracking. If the repression and the jamming frequency change at the same time, the jamming effects can be
more obvious. When the jamming signal's angular frequency is twice as large as the carrier frequency of the reticle
system, the seeker will can't receive an accurate signal and the jamming can be achieved. The jamming mechanism of
the conical-scan FM IR seeker is described and it is helpful to the airborne IR countermeasure system.},

  abstract  = {The reticle systems which are considered as the classical approach for determining the angular position of radiating targets in infrared band are widely used in early generation surface-to-air and air-to-air infrared guided missile seekers. One of the cost-effective ways of protecting aircrafts against these missiles is to dispense flare decoys from the countermeasure dispensing system (CMDS) integrated into the aircraft platform. Although this counter-measuring technique seems very simple, if not optimized carefully, it may not be effective for protecting the aircraft. Flares should be dispensed in accordance with a specific dispensing program which determines the number of flares to be dispensed from each dispenser of the CMDS and timing sequence of dispensing. Optimizing the parameters of the dispensing program is not trivial. It requires a good understanding of the operating principle of the threat seeker, operational capabilities of own platform and engagement scenario between them. In the present paper, we propose a complete simulation-based procedure to form an effectiveness boundary of flare dispensing programs against the spin-scan and conical-scan reticle seekers. The region of effectiveness is determined via Gaussian mixture models. The raw data is collected via extensive number of simulations using a MATLAB-coded simulator which models reticle-based seeker, aircraft radiation, aircraft motion, aircraft CMDS system, flare motion and flare radiation.},

use of CounterSim, a missile engagement and countermeasure simulation software tool, which has the
ability to model the full pre-launch phase of an engagement between a MANPAD and an aircraft. Three
MANPAD models are developed with one infrared (IR) seeker containing a track angle bias CCM capability

(PEH) when no IR decoys are used, when IR decoys are deployed reactively and when decoys are deployed preemptively.
These cases are simulated for seekers with no CCM and with a track angle bias CCM.
The results confirm that the rise rate CCM significantly reduces the PEH when IR decoys are used reactively. The use of
pre-emptive flares timed to deploy at or about the time when the seeker is uncaged increases the PEH significantly. A
more detailed investigation of the effects of aircraft aspect angle and flare timing on miss distance was carried out to
examine the effects of the CCM compared with no CCM. With the aircraft at an altitude of 1000m and a range of 2km
there is a critical period in which a flare needs to be released in order to achieve a significant miss distance when the
CCM is in use. The conical scan seeker used with the track angle bias CCM was the most effective combination
requiring the shortest time during which the flare had to be deployed. Further simulations at longer ranges and different
aircraft azimuth angles showed that there is a time window that is range dependant during which pre-emptive decoys are
fully effective independently of the aircraft azimuth or threat direction.},

  abstract  = {We present a new fractal based method of generating realistic models of natural landscapes. In this paper, we describe a three-steps method that produces a terrain mesh using ridge lines and rivers drainage network. As opposed to previous methods that compute water erosion for a given terrain model --- Digital Elevation Map ---, our terrain mesh is generated constrained by a precomputed set of ridge lines and rivers network. A skeleton of a ridges and rivers network is computed and stored in a Digital Elevation Map (D.E.M.) as initial values. Then, the elevations data set is enriched using a novel interpolation method based on a Midpoint Displacement's Inverse process. Finally, a midpoint displacement subdivision is applied to interpolate the remaining elevation coordinates. The resulting terrain meshes lead to naturalistic landscape models and our method seems to be very promising. Images produced by our model are presented.},

The instrument collected primarily at 32 cm\textsuperscript{-1} spectral and 100 Hz temporal resolutions. Munitions included unsuppressed and chemically flash suppressed propellants. Secondary combustion occurred with unsuppressed propellants resulting in flash emissions lasting ~100 ms and dominated by H2O and CO2 spectral structure. Non-combusting plume emissions were one-tenth as intense and approached background levels within 20–40 ms. A low-dimensional phenomenological model was used to reduce the data to temperatures, soot absorbances, and column densities of H2O, CO2, CH4, and CO. The combusting plumes exhibit peak temperatures of ~1400 K, areas of greater than 32 m2, low soot emissivity of ~0.04, with nearly all the CO converted to CO2. The non-combusting plumes exhibit lower temperatures of ~1000 K, areas of ~5 m2, soot emissivity of greater than 0.38 and CO as the primary product. Maximum fit residual relative to peak intensity are 14% and 8.9% for combusting and non-combusting plumes, respectively. The model was generalized to account for turbulence-induced variations in the muzzle plumes. Distributions of temperature and concentration in 1–2 spatial regions demonstrate a reduction in maximum residuals by 40%. A two-region model of combusting plumes provides a plausible interpretation as a ~1550 K, optically thick plume core and ~2550 K, thin, surface-layer flame-front. Temperature rate of change was used to characterize timescales and energy release for plume emissions. Heat of combustion was estimated to be ~5 MJ/kg."

This system provides spectroscopic imaging at any desired wavelength spanning a bandpass 430-860 nm, at four different spectral resolving powers (λ/Δλ) ranging from 300 to 9000. Our laboratory tests revealed a wavelength dependence of the etalon gap and parallelism with a maximum variation between 600-720 nm that arises because of the complex structure of the broadband multi-layer dielectric coatings. We also report an unanticipated optical effect of this multi-layer coating structure that produces a significant, and wavelength-dependent, change in the apparent shape of the etalon plates. This change is caused by two effects: the physical non-uniformities or thickness variations in the coating layers, and the wavelength dependence of the phase change upon reflection that can amplify these non-uniformities. We discuss the impact of these coating effects on the resolving power, finesse, and throughput of the system. This Fabry-P\'{e}rot system will provide a powerful tool for imaging spectroscopy on one of the world's largest telescopes.},

	(HFI) tests using potassium line emission sensors for the Air Force

	focus of research due to the high interest in both machine-gun fire
	and sniper geo-location via airborne systems. Several initial tests
	were accomplished in 2009 using small and medium caliber weapons
	including rifles. Based on these results, the Air Force Research
	Laboratory (AFRL) funded the Falcon Sentinel program in 2010 to provide
	for additional development of both the sensor concept, algorithm
	suite changes and verification of basic phenomenology including variance
	based on ammunition type for given weapons platform. Results from
	testing over the past 3 years have showed that the system would be
	able to detect and declare a sniper rifle at upwards of 3km, medium
	machine gun at 5km, and explosive events like hand-grenades at greater
	than 5km. This paper will outline the development of the sensor systems,
	algorithms used for detection and classification, and test results
	from VMWS prototypes as well as outline algorithms used for the VMWS.
	The Falcon Sentinel Program will be outlined and results shown. Finally,
	the paper will show the future work for ATD and transition efforts
	after the Falcon Sentinel program completed.},

Washington, USA. The observations are motivated by a proposed tidal energy pilot project, which will be required to
monitor for environmental effects. Potential monitoring methods also include visual observation, passive acoustics, and
active acoustics. The effectiveness of observations in the infrared spectrum is compared to observations in the visible
spectrum to assess the viability of infrared imagery for cetacean detection and classification. Imagery was obtained at
Lime Kiln Park, Washington from 7/6/10-7/9/10 using a FLIR Thermovision A40M infrared camera (7.5-14&mu;m,
37&deg;HFOV, 320x240 pixels) under ideal atmospheric conditions (clear skies, calm seas, and wind speed 0-4 m/s). Whales
were detected during both day (9 detections) and night (75 detections) at distances ranging from 42 to 162 m. The
temperature contrast between dorsal fins and the sea surface ranged from 0.5 to 4.6 &deg;C. Differences in emissivity from
sea surface to dorsal fin are shown to aid detection at high incidence angles (near grazing). A comparison to theory is
presented, and observed deviations from theory are investigated. A guide for infrared camera selection based on site
geometry and desired target size is presented, with specific considerations regarding marine mammal detection.
Atmospheric conditions required to use visible and infrared cameras for marine mammal detection are established and
compared with 2008 meteorological data for the proposed tidal energy site. Using conservative assumptions, infrared
observations are predicted to provide a 74% increase in hours of possible detection, compared with visual observations.},

The observable muzzle flashes had 50â€“100 ms durations and were collected with approximately 0.75 nm spectral and 10 Hz temporal resolutions. Atomic and molecular emissions were primarily limited to contaminant species including K, Na, Li, CaOH, CuOH, and CuO. A relatively strong continuum baseline was observed from hot particulate matter and plume-scattered solar radiation. A radiative transfer model was used to demonstrate self-absorption in an optically thick plume as the likely source of significant broadening of the potassium 4 2P3/2,1/2 â€“ 4 2S1/2 doublet. Indeed, the entire O2 (X-b) absorption band is evident in the blue wing. This feature is used to estimate range to source to within 4â€“9\% for individual firings and 0.5\% with multiple observations. Ratios of atomic line intensities were used to differentiate munitions configurations, yielding ratios of between-class variance to within-class variance of 8.6 to 18.2 using 1 to 4 atomic lines. Further reduction of the number of features by characterizing the relative atomic line intensities by a temperature parameter (T = 7900â€“8900 K) significantly degrades class discrimination. },

  abstract       = {The Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission has been selected as ESAâ€™s 8th Earth Explorer mission. The primary objectives of the mission are to provide global estimates of vegetation fluorescence, actual photosynthetic activity, and vegetation stress. FLEX will fly in tandem formation with Sentinel-3 providing ancillary data for atmospheric characterization and correction, vegetation related spectral indices, and land surface temperature. The purpose of this manuscript is to present its scientific payload, FLORIS, which is a push-broom hyperspectral imager, flying on a medium size platform. FLORIS will measure the vegetation fluorescence in the spectral range between 500 nm and 780 nm at medium spatial resolution (300 m) and over a swath of 150 km. It accommodates an imaging spectrometer with a very high spectral resolution (0.3 nm), to measure the fluorescence spectrum within two oxygen absorption bands (O2A and O2B), and a second spectrometer with lower spectral resolution to derive additional atmospheric and vegetation parameters. A compact opto-mechanical solution is the current instrument baseline. A polarization scrambler is placed in front of a common dioptric telescope serving both spectrometers to minimize the polarization sensitivity. The telescope images the ground scene onto a double slit assembly. The radiation is spectrally dispersed onto the focal planes of the grating spectrometers. Special attention has been given to the mitigation of stray-light which is a key factor to reach good accuracy of the fluorescence measurement. The absolute radiometric calibration is achieved by observing a dedicated Sun illuminated Lambertian diffuser, while the spectral calibration in flight is performed by means of vicarious techniques. The thermal stabilization is achieved by using two passive radiators looking directly to the cold space, counterbalanced by heaters in a closed loop system. The focal planes are based on custom developed CCDs. The opto-mechanical design is robust, stable vs. temperature and easy to align. The optical quality is very good as recently demonstrated by the latest tests of an elegant breadboard. The scientific data products comprise the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance measurements as well as fluorescence estimates and higher-level products related to the health status of the vegetation addressing a wide range of applications from agriculture to forestry and climate.},

distribution of the UAV plume was calculated based on the eddy current propagation theory. And then, spectral infrared
radiation characteristics of the UAV plume at 2-5ï¿½m were obtained by the single band C-G approximation method. The
results show that the temperature in the core area of the UAV plume is higher , and the infared radiation characteristics
are stable and obvious. The infrared radiation energy of the plume mainly ditributed at the infrared wavelength of 2.7ï¿½m
and 4.5ï¿½m,which is in accordance with the actual situation. The results maybe contribute to the further study of the

Instead of solving a dynamic optimization problem, which results in complex guidance laws that require the estimation of target maneuver and time-to-go, the guidance law is a priori chosen to be proportional navigation (PN). Then, an optimal tuning problem is solved. That is, the \{PN\} constant and the coefficients of the guidance transfer function are optimized to yield zero miss distance (ZMD) against any deterministic or random target maneuver subject to the constraint of limited missile maneuverability. It is shown that when the overall guidance transfer function is positive real, and the \{PN\} constant is some given function of the missile---target maneuver ratio, \{ZMD\} is obtained. A considerable part of this paper is devoted to a comprehensive treatment of the practical aspects of the theory. Implementation of the new guidance law is illustrated using real-life missile models, and its performance is compared to \{PN\} and optimal guidance (derived from dynamic optimization) using both deterministic and statistical tests. The results obtained are promising. },

  abstract = {In this paper, a new approach to guidance of homing missiles is considered. Instead of solving a dynamic optimization problem, which results in complex guidance laws that require the estimation of target maneuver and time-to-go, the guidance law is a priori chosen to be proportional navigation (PN). Then, an optimal tuning problem is solved. That is, the \{PN\} constant and the coefficients of the guidance transfer function are optimized to yield zero miss distance (ZMD) against any deterministic or random target maneuver subject to the constraint of limited missile maneuverability. It is shown that when the overall guidance transfer function is positive real, and the \{PN\} constant is some given function of the missile---target maneuver ratio, \{ZMD\} is obtained. A considerable part of this paper is devoted to a comprehensive treatment of the practical aspects of the theory. Implementation of the new guidance law is illustrated using real-life missile models, and its performance is compared to \{PN\} and optimal guidance (derived from dynamic optimization) using both deterministic and statistical tests.
