## Installation and Requirements

`libRadtranDask` requires Python 3.

A working installation of [libRadtran](http://www.libradtran.org) is required to compute radiant environment  maps and atmospheric transmittance. In the Monte carlo/statistical mode of operation, a compute clusteris generally required to achieve adequate sampling in a reasonable time. 

Parallel computation is performed  using the [`Dask`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) package, which works in  IPython/Jupyter notebooks as well as other Python launch modes.
 
`libRadtranDask` has been developed and tested using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution from [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/).
