\chapter{Porting \texttt{scr\_py} to Python 3}
\label{chap:Portingscr_pytoPython3}

Note: the files currently in the 
\lstinline{libraddask\libradtran}
folder were originally from \libradtran{} 2.0.2, and ported to Python 3.
The Python 3 port of the \libradtran{} 2.0.3 files are still in process.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:Portingscr_pytoPython3}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change all print statement lines to print function lines.

\item Python 3 changed the local import syntax. All local imports must be `from . import xxx`. This rippled through to hundreds of changes.



\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}



\item Updated Python 2 `file` type tests to Python 3 `io.IOBase` tests.

\item Numerous cases where integers were expected and floats were provided (Python 3 is stricter and does not do automatic conversions)

\end{enumerate}
